# Running Locally - Minikube - k8s

It is quite straightforward to deploy Conductor to Kubernetes. We learned how to use docker-compose in our previous
article here. We can
follow [the guide here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/translate-compose-kubernetes/) to
convert our docker-compose into a working kubernetes installation.

This guide will walk through step by step on how this works. In case you find any steps as not working, please check the
link above to see if there are any updates. You can also help us by editing this page if you find any discrepancy.

### Prerequisites

1. Install minikube or a similar Kubernetes cluster in your local or development environment
