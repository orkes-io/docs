# Worker Task

A Worker task (denoted as SIMPLE task) is used to run custom logic implemented in any language. The custom logic can be deployed anywhere and the Worker task requires an external worker for polling.

:::info Prerequisites
Before adding a Worker task to a workflow, you should complete the following:

- Create a worker to run a custom task.
- Define the task in Conductor using Conductor UI or [API](/reference-docs/api/metadata/creating-task-definitions).

For a full guide on how to use workers, refer to [Writing Workers](/developer-guides/using-workers).

## Task parameters

To configure the Worker task, set its `inputParameters` as needed for your worker code. The values can be [passed as a dynamic input](/developer-guides/passing-inputs-to-task-in-conductor).

The following are generic configuration parameters that can be applied to the task and are not specific to the Worker task. 

<details>
<summary>Caching parameters</summary>

You can cache the task outputs using the following parameters. Refer to [Caching Task Outputs](/faqs/task-cache-output) for a full guide.

| Parameter | Description | Required/ Optional | 
| --------- | ----------- | ----------------- | 
| cacheConfig.**ttlInSecond** | The time to live in seconds, which is the duration for the output to be cached. | Required if using *cacheConfig*. |
| cacheConfig.**key** | The cache key is a unique identifier for the cached output and must be constructed exclusively from the task’s input parameters.<br/>It can be a string concatenation that contains the task’s input keys, such as `${uri}-${method}` or `re_${uri}_${method}`. | Required if using *cacheConfig*. |

</details>

<details>
<summary>Schema parameters</summary>

You can enforce input/output validation for the task using the following parameters. Refer to [Schema Validation](/developer-guides/schema-validation) for a full guide.

| Parameter | Description | Required/ Optional | 
| --------- | ----------- | ----------------- | 
| taskDefinition.**enforceSchema** | Whether to enforce schema validation for task inputs/outputs. Set to *true* to enable validation. | Optional. | 
| taskDefinition.**inputSchema** | The name and type of the input schema to be associated with the task. | Required if *enforceSchema* is set to true. | 
| taskDefinition.**outputSchema** | The name and type of the output schema to be associated with the task. | Required if *enforceSchema* is set to true.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Other generic parameters</summary> 

Here are other parameters for configuring the task behavior.

| Parameter | Description | Required/ Optional | 
| --------- | ----------- | ----------------- | 
| optional | Whether the task is optional. <br/><br/>If set to`true`, any task failure is ignored, and the workflow continues with the task status updated to `COMPLETED_WITH_ERRORS`. However, the task must reach a terminal state. If the task remains incomplete, the workflow waits until it reaches a terminal state before proceeding. | Optional. | 

</details>

## Task configuration

This is the task configuration for a Worker task.

```json
{
  "name": "task_name",
  "taskReferenceName": "task_name_ref",
  "inputParameters": {},
  "type": "SIMPLE"
}
```

## Task output

The Worker task will return the output defined in your worker code.

## Adding a Worker task in UI

**To add a Worker task:**

1. In your workflow, select the **(+)** icon to add a new task. There are two ways to add a worker task:
   - Search for your task using its task name (created previously) and select to add it to the workflow.
   - Add a **Worker Task (Simple)** and enter the task name in Task Definition. This creates a new task definition.
2. Configure the task, such as its inputs, caching, schema validation, and optionality.

Sample worker code snippets are available in the UI for reference.

## Examples

Find an [example of how to add and run a Worker task](/quickstarts/write-workers) in our Quickstart guide.
