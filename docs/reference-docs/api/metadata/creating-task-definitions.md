# Creating Task Definitions

Tasks are the building blocks of workflow in Conductor. A task can be an operator, system task or custom code written in any programming language. This API is used to create task definitions in Orkes Conductor.

## Input Payload

You can configure task definitions directly via UI and using API. The task definitions include the following parameters:

| concurrentExecLimit                                | Indicates the number of tasks that can be executed at any given time. <br/><br/>For example, if you have 1000 task executions waiting in the queue and 1000 workers polling this queue for tasks, but if you have set *concurrentExecLimit* to 10, only ten tasks would be given to workers (which would lead to starvation). If any of the workers finish execution, a new task(s) will be removed from the queue while still keeping the current execution count to 10.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| rateLimitFrequencyInSeconds, rateLimitPerFrequency | <ul><li>**rateLimitFrequencyInSeconds** sets the frequency window, which is the duration to be used in events per duration.</li><li>**rateLimitPerFrequency** defines the number of tasks that can be given to workers per given frequency window.</li></ul>**Note**: Rate limiting is only supported for the Redis persistence module and is unavailable with other persistence layers.<br/><br/>For example, let’s set **rateLimitFrequencyInSeconds=5**, and **rateLimitPerFrequency=12**. This means our frequency window is 5 seconds in duration, and for each frequency window, the Conductor would only give 12 tasks to workers. So, in a given minute, the Conductor would only give 12*(60/5) = 144 tasks to workers, irrespective of the number of workers polling for the task.<br/>Unlike **concurrentExecLimit**, rate limiting doesn't consider the tasks already in progress/completed. Even if all the previous tasks are executed within 1 sec or would take a few days, the new tasks are still given to workers at configured frequency, 144 tasks per minute in the above example. |
