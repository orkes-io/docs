# Creating Workflow Definition

Workflow can be defined as the collection of tasks and operators that specifies the order and execution of the defined tasks. This API is used to create workflow definitions in Orkes Conductor.

## Input Payload

You can configure workflow definition directly via UI and using API. The workflow definition include the following parameters:

| Attribute                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| name                          | Provide a unique name to identify the workflow. This field is mandatory.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| description                   | Include a description to indicate the purpose of the workflow. This field is optional.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| version                       | You can give versions to the workflow to keep track of the changes. By default, the value is 1.                                                                                                                                                        |
| tasks                         | You can provide the tasks to be executed in the workflow here. If the task type is an operator or a system task, it is handled by the Conductor server. For user-defined/worker tasks, a worker running outside the Conductor environment is required. |
| inputParameters               | Indicates the input values for the workflow.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| outputParameters              | Indicates the output values of the workflow.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| schemaVersion                 | Indicates the version number of the workflow definition schema.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| restartable                   | Set this value to **true** to restart a completed workflow. If restarting a completed workflow can impact the functioning, set this value to **false**.                                                                                                |
| workflowStatusListenerEnabled | Setting the workflowStatusListenerEnabled field in your Workflow Definition to **true** enables notifications.
                                                                 |
| ownerEmail                    | This field will be auto-populated with the userâ€™s email address.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| timeoutSeconds                | Time (in seconds), after which the workflow is marked as TIMED_OUT if not completed after transitioning to IN_PROGRESS status for the first time. No timeout occurs if the value is set to 0.                                                           |
| timeoutPolicy                 | Indicates the condition at which the workflow should time out. It can take any of the following values:<ul><li>**TIME_OUT_WF** - The workflow status is marked as TIMEOUT and is terminated.</li><li>**ALERT_ONLY** - Registers a counter.</li></ul>   |
| failureWorkflow               | Provide the workflow name to be triggered upon a failure of the execution of this workflow.                                                                                                                                                            |


## API Endpoint

```
POST /api/metadata/workflow
```

When a workflow definition is updated via API, it automatically increments the workflow version to the latest.
