# Retry Failed Workflow

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/workflow/{workflowId}/retry`

Retries a failed workflow execution from the last failed task. When invoked, the failed task is scheduled again, and the workflow moves to RUNNING status.

## Path parameters

| Parameter  | Description                                            | Type   | Required/ Optional |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------ | ------------------ |
| workflowId | The execution ID of the failed workflow to be retried. | string | Required.          |

## Query parameters

| Parameter              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Type    | Required/ Optional |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- | ------------------ |
| resumeSubworkflowTasks | (For cases where the last failed task is a Sub Workflow task) If set to true, the parent workflow is restarted from the sub-workflow’s last failed task. If set to false, a new sub-workflow execution is created. Default is false. | boolean | Optional.          |
| retryIfRetriedByParent | (For cases where a sub-workflow is being retried) If set to false, the sub-workflow will be prohibited from retrying if its parent workflow has been retried before. Default is true.                                                | boolean | Optional.          |

## Response

Returns 204 No Content, indicating that the workflow execution has been restarted successfully from the last failed task.

## Examples

<summary>Retry failed workflow from last failed task</summary>

**Request**

```shell
curl -X 'POST' \
   'https://<YOUR-SERVER-URL>/api/workflow/2ce9207f-d4a6-11ef-87b1-b2b27c52ebde/retry' \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'X-Authorization: <TOKEN>' \
  -d ''
```

**Response**

Returns 204 No Content, indicating that the workflow execution has been restarted successfully from the last failed task.

In the Conductor UI, the workflow execution will re-enter the RUNNING status, and the last failed task will be re-attempted.

**Request**

```shell

  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'X-Authorization: <TOKEN>' \
  -d ''
```

**Response**

Returns 204 No Content, indicating that the workflow execution has been restarted successfully from the last failed task.

In the Conductor UI, both the parent workflow and sub-workflow execution will re-enter the RUNNING status.

<summary>Retry failed workflow from last failed Sub Workflow task when resumeSubworkflowTasks=false</summary>

**Request**

```shell
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://<YOUR-SERVER-URL>/api/workflow/35831168-50da-11f0-bb6c-9aabfb2793e8/retry?resumeSubworkflowTasks=false' \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'X-Authorization: <TOKEN>' \
  -d ''
```

**Response**

Returns 204 No Content, indicating that the workflow execution has been restarted successfully from the last failed task.

In the Conductor UI, the parent workflow execution will re-enter the RUNNING status, and a new sub-workflow execution instance will be created.

<summary>Retry sub-workflow when retryIfRetriedByParent=false</summary>

This example demonstrates how a retry attempt on a sub-workflow is blocked when:

1. A sub-workflow has failed.
2. Its parent workflow has already been retried.
3. A retry is attempted on the sub-workflow with `retryIfRetriedByParent=false`.

Start a workflow that includes a sub-workflow. Initially, both executions are in RUNNING status.

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="/content/img/parent-and-child-workflow-in-running-state.png"
    alt="Both workflows in RUNNING state."
    width="100%"
    height="auto"
    style={{ paddingBottom: 40, paddingTop: 40 }}
  />
</p>

Now, let’s assume the sub workflow failed, resulting in both the sub-workflow and the parent workflow entering FAILED status.

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="/content/img/parent-and-child-workflow-in-failed-state.png"
    alt="Both workflows in FAILED state."
    width="100%"
    height="auto"
    style={{ paddingBottom: 40, paddingTop: 40 }}
  />
</p>

Use the following API call to retry the parent workflow:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://<YOUR-SERVER-URL>/api/workflow<PARENT-WORKFLOW-ID>/retry' \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'X-Authorization: <TOKEN>' \
  -d ''
```

The parent workflow is successfully retried and transitions to RUNNING. The previous sub-workflow execution remains FAILED.

Now attempt to retry the initially failed sub-workflow using the following call with `retryIfRetriedByParent=false`:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://<YOUR-SERVER-URL>/api/workflow/<SUB-WORKFLOW-ID>/retry?retryIfRetriedByParent=false' \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'X-Authorization: <TOKEN>' \
  -d ''
  ```

**Response**

```json
{
  "status": 400,
  "message": "Parent task fd7sdfe33153-71df-11f0-af9d-8e9bff353733 of workflow fd7sd6e353e6-71df-11f0-9288-1a521d72d3b3 is already retried, retrying subworkflow fd7sdfe442c4-71df-11f0-af9d-8e9bff353733 is prohibited because retryIfHasParent=false in retry request",
  "instance": "orkes-conductor-deployment-84d9984cb8-r7rrd",
  "retryable": false
}
```

This error confirms that Conductor blocks the retry because the parent workflow has already been retried, and `retryIfRetriedByParent=false` prohibits retrying the sub-workflow independently.
