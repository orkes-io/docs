# Get Poll Data for All Tasks

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/tasks/queue/polldata/all`

Gets the last poll data for all the tasks in the Conductor task queue. The filter parameters can be used to refine the request based on your requirements. Multiple filters are applied with AND logic and can be combined (worker + queue + lastPoll).

## Query parameters

| Parameter        | Description                                                                                                                       | Type    | Required/ Optional                      |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------- |
| workerSize       | The number of worker instances polling for all the tasks in the queue.                                                            | integer | Optional.                               |
| workerOpt        | Option to filter based on the worker size. Supported values:<ul><li>**GT** (Greater than)</li><li>**LT** (Less than)</li></ul>    | string  | Required if _workerSize_ is used.       |
| queueSize        | The total number of tasks in the queue waiting to be executed.                                                                    | integer | Optional.                               |
| queueOpt         | Option to filter based on the queue size. Supported values:<ul><li>**GT** (Greater than)</li><li>**LT** (Less than)</li></ul>     | string  | Required if _queueSize_ is used.        |
| lastPollTimeSize | The last polled time in [Unix timestamp format](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/).                                                  | integer | Optional.                               |
| lastPollTimeOpt  | Option to filter based on the last poll time. Supported values:<ul><li>**GT** (Greater than)</li><li>**LT** (Less than)</li></ul> | string  | Required if _lastPollTimeSize_ is used. |

## Response

Returns a map containing _queueData_ and an array of _pollData_.

- **queueData**: Indicates the size and poll count of each task. 
- **pollData**: Includes the _queueName_, _workerId_, and _lastPollTime_ for each task.
  - **queueName**: The name of the task queue. For predefined tasks, this returns the task type, such as _HTTP_. For user-defined tasks, it returns the task definition name, such as _python_worker_.
  - **workerId**: The worker name from which the task is being polled, which is the hostname of the pod where the worker is running.
  - **lastPollTime**: The last polled time in [Unix timestamp format](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/).

If a worker has not picked up the task, no *pollData* will be available, and the array will be empty.

## Examples

<details>
<summary>Get the last poll data for tasks with a queue size greater than 7</summary>

**Request**

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://<YOUR-SERVER-URL>/api/tasks/queue/polldata/all?queueSize=7&queueOpt=GT' \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'X-Authorization: <TOKEN>'
```

**Response**

```json
{
  "queueData": {
    "_deciderQueue": {
      "size": 31
    },
    "WAIT": {
      "pollerCount": 1,
      "size": 18
    },
    "_batch_upload_queue0": {
      "size": 15
    }
  },
  "pollData": [
    {
      "queueName": "WAIT",
      "workerId": "acme-workers-deployment-5cf6957cdf-rn2pd",
      "lastPollTime": 1735561620048
    }
  ]
}
```

Here, *pollData* is available only for the WAIT task, as it is the only one the worker has picked up, while the rest of the tasks are in the queue awaiting workers.
