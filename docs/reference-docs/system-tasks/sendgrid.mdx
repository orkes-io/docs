# SendGrid

The SendGrid task is used to send emails through the SendGrid platform. Use this task in workflows when you need to programmatically deliver emails such as alerts, confirmations, or updates.

The task uses a pre-configured SendGrid integration for authentication and delivery. Upon execution, it connects to the SendGrid API and sends the email as defined in the task configuration, which includes the sender and recipient email addresses, email subject, and message body.

:::info Prerequisites
- [Integrate SendGrid](/content/integrations/email/sendgrid) with Orkes Conductor.

## Adding a SendGrid task in UI

**To add a SendGrid task:**

1. In your workflow, select the (**+**) icon and add a **SendGrid** task.
2. In **From**, enter the [verified SendGrid sender email](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sendgrid/for-developers/sending-email/sender-identity).
3. In **To**, enter the recipient’s email address.
4. In **Content Type**, select the type of email content as *text/plain* or *text/html*.
5. In **Content**, enter the email body.
6. In **SendGrid Configuration**, select the SendGrid integration added to the cluster.

## Examples

Here are some examples for using the SendGrid task.

<details>
<summary>Using the SendGrid task in a workflow</summary>
<p>

Notification workflows are common when end users must be alerted, such as for payments, alerts, or failures.

Consider a scenario where an organization uses SendGrid as its email notification platform. To create a simple email notification flow using Orkes Conductor, first [create a SendGrid integration](https://orkes.io/content/integrations/email/sendgrid) in your Conductor cluster.

Once the integration is created, note its name. For example, let’s use “SendGrid”.

The following workflow uses this integration to send an email notification. To create the workflow in the Conductor UI:

1. Go to **Definitions** > **Workflow** from the left navigation menu on your Conductor cluster.
2. Select **+ Define workflow**.
3. In the **Code** tab, paste the following code, replacing your SendGrid integration name and sender email:

```json
{
 "name": "email-notification-workflow",
 "description": "Email notification workflow using SendGrid",
 "version": 1,
 "tasks": [
   {
     "name": "sendgrid",
     "taskReferenceName": "sendgrid_ref",
     "inputParameters": {
       "from": "john.doe@acme.com", //Verified sender email in SendGrid
       "to": "${workflow.input.recipientEmail}",
       "subject": "Your renewal failed",
       "contentType": "text/plain",
       "content": "Hello, This is to notify that your subscription renewal for XYZ failed. ",
       "sendgridConfiguration": "SendGrid" // Integration name in Orkes Conductor
     },
     "type": "SENDGRID"
   }
 ],
 "inputParameters": [
   "recipientEmail"
 ],
 "schemaVersion": 2
}
```

After saving the workflow, go to the **Run** tab, enter the recipient email address in the input parameter field, and select **Execute** to run the workflow.

<center><p><img src="/content/img/email-notification-workflow-execution.gif" alt="Executing email notification workflow in Orkes Conductor" width="100%" height="auto"/></p></center>

This starts the workflow and opens the workflow execution page, where you can monitor its progress. After the workflow is complete, the status changes to **Completed**.

Verify email delivery from the recipient’s inbox.
