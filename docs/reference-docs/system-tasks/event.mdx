# Event

The Event task is used to publish events into eventing systems. It supports various message brokers, including AMQP, Amazon MSK, AWS SQS, Azure Service Bus, Confluent Kafka, Apache Kafka, NATS Messaging, GCP Pub/Sub, and IBM MQ.

An Event task publishes a message to an event queue or topic. The specific eventing system used depends on the configured sink. The sink parameter defines the message broker type, integration name, and queue/topic name. The task execution payload is sent to this sink, and Conductor automatically appends additional system input parameters to the payload.

:::info Prerequisites

- [Integrate the required message broker](/category/integrations/message-broker) with Orkes Conductor.
- Ensure the required topic/queue is created within your message broker.

## Task parameters

Configure these parameters for the Event task.

| Parameter       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Required/ Optional |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| sink            | The event queue sink in the format: <br/>**message-broker-type:integration-name:topic/queue-name**<br/>Where,<ul><li>**message-broker-type**—The message broker type where the payload is being sent.

<summary>Schema parameters</summary>

You can enforce input/output validation for the task using the following parameters. Refer to [Schema Validation](/developer-guides/schema-validation) for a full guide.

| Parameter | Description | Required/ Optional | 
| --------- | ----------- | ----------------- | 
| taskDefinition.**enforceSchema** | Whether to enforce schema validation for task inputs/outputs. Set to *true* to enable validation. | Optional. |

### Additional system inputs to payload​

Conductor automatically adds the following parameters to the payload. Ensure that these fields are not present in the payload, as they will be overwritten during execution.

- **workflowInstanceId**–Workflow (execution) ID from where this event was sent.
- **workflowType**–Name of the workflow definition.
- **workflowVersion**–Version of the workflow definition.
- **correlationId**–Correlation ID of the workflow execution.

**Example**

Given the following task configuration:

```json
{
  "name": "event_task",
  "taskReferenceName": "event_task_ref",
  "type": "EVENT",
  "sink": "kafka:integration-name:topic-name",
  "inputParameters": {
    "myKey": "myValue",
    "myNumber": 100
  }
}
```

The execution will produce the following input parameters:

```json
{
  "myKey": "myValue",
  "myNumber": 100,
  "workflowInstanceId": "967b19ae-10d1-4b23-b0e7-ae324524dac0",
  "workflowType": "my-workflow-name",
  "workflowVersion": "1",
  "correlationId": "fbdcafd2-69c7-4b75-8dd1-653e33d48746"
}
```

## Task configuration

This is the task configuration for an Event task.

```json
{
  "name": "event",
  "taskReferenceName": "event_ref",
  "type": "EVENT",
  "sink": "messaging-type:integration-name:queue-or-topic-name",
  "inputParameters": {}
}
```

## Task output

The task output mirrors the payload sent during execution, including system-appended parameters. For example:

```json
{
 "eventId": "13a6bdfa-e375-4e87-af46-8ba66572ad9c",
 "sink": "messaging-type:integration-name:queue-or-topic-name",
 "workflowType": "eventTest",
 "correlationId": null,
 "workflowVersion": 1,
 "_createdBy": "john.doe@acme.com",
 "workflowInstanceId": "2610b755-c147-11f0-92e1-ae47cf6bc1ce"
}
```

## Adding an Event task in UI

**To add an Event task:**

1. In your workflow, select the (**+**) icon and add an **Event** task.
2. In **Sink**, select the required integration and append the topic/queue name. Failure to do so may result in execution errors, as the payload won't have a valid destination.
3. (Optional) Add any additional input parameters.

## Examples

Here are some examples for using the Event task.

<details>
<summary>Using an Event task in a workflow</summary>

In this example, we will integrate AWS SQS with Orkes Conductor to publish messages to an SQS queue.

1. Integrate AWS SQS with Orkes Conductor.
2. Create a Workflow with an Event task.
3. Run Workflow.
4. Verify message delivery in AWS SQS.

**Step 1: Integrate AWS SQS with Orkes Conductor**

In this example, you integrate AWS SQS using the connection type “Access Key/Secret.” For this, you need the following credentials from your AWS account:

- **Region**: The region of your AWS account. For example, _**us-east-1**_.
- **Account ID**: The account ID available in your AWS account details.
- **Access Key** and **Access Secret**: Create an IAM user with the ***AmazonSQSFullAccess*** permission, and then generate the access credentials.
- **SQS queue**: A queue to receive events from Conductor.

Once you have these credentials, add the integration to your Conductor cluster.

1. Go to **Integrations** from the left navigation menu on your Conductor cluster.
2. [Create a new integration for Amazon SQS](https://orkes.io/content/integrations/message-broker/aws-sqs) using the credentials you retrieved.

<center><p><img src="/content/img/aws-sqs-integration.png" alt="AWS SQS sample integration" width="50%" height="auto"/></p></center>

**Step 2: Create a Workflow with an Event task**

This step involves creating a workflow with an Event task. Here, you use the AWS SQS queue as the sink for the event.

For testing purposes, you can quickly build a workflow using the Conductor UI.

**To create a workflow:**

1. Go to **Definitions** > **Workflow**, and select **+ Define Workflow**.
2. Add an **Event** task with the Sink `sqs:<your-integration-name>:<your-queue-name>`.

Here’s the complete workflow definition JSON:

```json
{
 "name": "eventTest",
 "description": "A workflow that sends workflow details to AWS SQS queue",
 "version": 1,
 "tasks": [
   {
     "name": "event",
     "taskReferenceName": "event_ref",
     "type": "EVENT",
     "sink": "sqs:<your-integration-name>:<your-queue-name>" //Replace with your integration and queue name
   }
 ],
 "schemaVersion": 2
}
```

4. Save the workflow.

**Step 3: Run Workflow**

To run the workflow, select the **Execute** button from the workflow definition page.

<center><p><img src="/content/img/running-sqs-workflow-from-ui.png" alt="Running workflow from Conductor UI" width="80%" height="auto"/></p></center>

This takes you to the workflow execution page, where you can view the workflow status. Once the workflow is complete, you can view the workflow output payload sent to the SQS queue.

<center><p><img src="/content/img/workflow-output.png" alt="Workflow output passed into SQS queue" width="100%" height="auto"/></p></center>

**Step 4: Verify message delivery in AWS SQS**

Next, verify the message delivery in the SQS console.

1. In your Amazon SQS console, go to **Amazon SQS** > **Queues** > Select your queue.
2. Select **Send and receive messages**.

<center><p><img src="/content/img/sqs-queue.png" alt="Viewing the SQS queue in SQS console" width="100%" height="auto"/></p></center>

3. Scroll down to **Receive messages** and select **Poll for messages**.

<center><p><img src="/content/img/poll-for-messages.png" alt="Polling for messages from the queue" width="100%" height="auto"/></p></center>

4. The message ID appears, which is the `eventId` passed from Conductor. Select it to view the message body, which is the output of the Conductor workflow.

<center><p><img src="/content/img/message-body.png" alt="SQS message body received" width="100%" height="auto"/></p></center>

5. In the **Attributes** tab, you can view the task ID and the workflow execution ID.

<center><p><img src="/content/img/queue-attribute.png" alt="Attribute containing the task and workflow execution ID" width="70%" height="auto"/></p></center>

That’s it, you have sent the message to the SQS queue. You can extend this workflow based on your requirements by customizing the Event task’s input to suit your use case.
