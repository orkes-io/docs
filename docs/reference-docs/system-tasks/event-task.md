# Event Task

```json
"type" : "EVENT"
```

### Introduction

EVENT is a task used to publish an event into one of the supported eventing systems in Conductor.
Conductor supports the following eventing models:

1. Conductor internal events (type: conductor)
2. SQL (type: sqs)

### Use Cases

Consider a use case where at some point in the execution, an event is published to an external eventing system such as SQS.
Event tasks are useful for creating event-based dependencies for workflows and tasks.

Consider an example where we want to publish an event into SQS to notify an external system.

```json
{
  "type": "EVENT",
  "sink": "sqs:sqs_queue_name",
  "asyncComplete": false
}
```

An example is when we want to publish a message to Conductor's internal queuing system.

```json
{
  "type": "EVENT",
  "sink": "conductor:internal_event_name",
  "asyncComplete": false
}
```

### Configuration

#### Input Configuration

| Attribute         | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name              | Task Name. A unique name that is descriptive of the task function                                                                                                               |
| taskReferenceName | Task Reference Name. A unique reference to this task. There can be multiple references of a task within the same workflow definition                                            |
| type              | Task Type. In this case, `EVENT`                                                                                                                                                |
| sink              | External event queue in the format of `prefix:location`. The Prefix is either `sqs` or `conductor`, and `location` specifies the actual queue name. e.g. "sqs:send_email_queue" |

#### Output Configuration

The Tasks' output is sent as a payload to the external event. In the case of SQS, the task's output is sent as a payload to the SQS message.

### Supported Queuing Systems

Conductor has support for the following external event queueing systems as part of the OSS build

1. SQS (prefix: sqs)
2. [NATS](https://github.com/Netflix/conductor-community/tree/main/event-queue) (prefix: nats)
3. [AMQP](https://github.com/Netflix/conductor-community/tree/main/event-queue/amqp) (prefix: amqp_queue or amqp_exchange)
4. Internal Conductor (prefix: conductor)
   To add support for other

## Example

See the [Sending SQS messages](/content/docs/how-tos/Tasks/SQS-event-task) tutorial for an example EVENT task.
