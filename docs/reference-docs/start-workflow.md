# Start Workflow Task

```json
"type" : "START_WORKFLOW"
```

Start Workflow is an operator task used to start another workflow from an existing workflow. Unlike a sub-workflow task, a start workflow task doesn’t create a relationship between the current workflow and the newly started workflow. That means it doesn’t wait for the started workflow to get completed.

A start workflow task is considered successful when the requested workflow begins or, more precisely, when the requested workflow is in the _RUNNING_ state.

## Use Cases

The start workflow task comes into use when you need to only start another workflow from a current workflow and need not necessarily complete the started workflow.

## Configurations

A start workflow task can be defined as `“type” : “START_WORKFLOW”`. To proceed with the workflow creation, you must specify the input parameters:

## Input Parameters

| Attribute     | Description                                                                                                                        |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| startWorkflow | Provide the workflow name to be started.                                                                                           |
| version       | If the workflow has different versions, you can provide the version to be started here. If not specified, the latest version runs. |

## Output Parameters

| Attribute  | Description                              |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| workflowId | Displays the ID of the started workflow. |

## Example

Let’s see a sample JSON file for the start workflow task:

```json
{
  "name": "sample_start_workflow",
  "description": "Sample Workflow to start a new workflow.",
  "version": 1,
  "tasks": [
    {
      "name": "start",
      "taskReferenceName": "start_ref",
      "inputParameters": {
        "startWorkflow": {
          "name": "your_workflow_name_to_be_started",
          "version": 3,
          "input": {}
        }
      },
      "type": "START_WORKFLOW"
    }
  ]
}
```

Here the input parameters are defined as:

```json
 "inputParameters": {
       "startWorkflow": {
        "name": "your_workflow_name_to_be_started",
        "version": 3
       }
       },
```

This would start your workflow named **“your_workflow_name_to_be_started”** with the version being 3.

The output shows the generated workflow ID of the started workflow.

```json
{
workflowId"8ca4184e-6a52-11ed-aaf5-f62716e2ae41"
}
```

From the workflow executions page, you can click on **Start Workflow** on the Summary tab to see the newly started workflow status.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/start-workflow-output-in-conductor.png" alt="Completed start workflow type" width="100%" height="auto" style={{paddingBottom: 40, paddingTop: 40}} /></p>

Even if the started workflow is not completed, the main workflow would be completed, i.e., in this case, even if the workflow **your_workflow_name_to_started** is not completed, the main workflow **sample_start_workflow** would be completed.
