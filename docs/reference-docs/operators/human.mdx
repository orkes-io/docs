# Human

The Human task allows human interaction within a workflow. When execution reaches a Human task, Conductor assigns a form to a user or group and waits for it to be completed. After the form is submitted, the task records the input, and the workflow continues.

A Human task can be used for a variety of human-involved tasks, such as manual approval in an expense approval workflow or a user intake form in a hotel booking workflow.

To support human-involved tasks, the Human task can be used alongside the following Orkes features:

- **User Forms**—A form builder to create user forms hosted on your Conductor cluster.
- **Human Tasks API**—A suite of APIs that manage the lifecycle of Human tasks connected to Conductor workflows.

:::info Prerequisites
Before adding a Human task to a workflow, you should complete the following:

- Create a user form in Orkes Conductor.
- Define the Human task in Conductor.

For a complete guide on how to use human-involved tasks, refer to the [Human Task Orchestration guide](docs/developer-guides/orchestrating-human-tasks.mdx).
:::

## Task parameters

When creating a workflow, you can configure the Human task with assignment and trigger policies.

- **Assignment policy**—Define who can fill out the form, how long the form is assigned to them, and what to do if the assignment times out.
  - If not configured, the task is not restricted and can be completed by anyone.
  - Multiple assignment policies can be added to create a multi-level assignment chain. If the first group fails to pick the assignment within the specified timeframe, the task will be escalated to the next assigned group.
  - Additional assignment policies cannot be added if the preceding assignment policy has no specified expiry timeframe.
- **Trigger policy**—Trigger a workflow to start if the task state or details change.

Here are all the parameters for the Human task.

In addition, you should also configure Human task’s `inputParameters`, which contain the fields taken from its associated user form. The configuration depends on the input source:

- If the field is to be filled up by the assignee, leave the value empty.
- If the field is read-only, set the value explicitly. You can use static values or [dynamic variables](/content/developer-guides/passing-inputs-to-task-in-conductor) to pass data from workflow inputs or previous task outputs.

The following are generic configuration parameters that can be applied to the task and are not specific to the Human task.

<details>
<summary>Other generic parameters</summary>

Here are other parameters for configuring the task behavior.

| Parameter | Description | Required/ Optional | 
| --------- | ----------- | ----------------- | 
| optional | Whether the task is optional. <br/><br/>If set to`true`, any task failure is ignored, and the workflow continues with the task status updated to `COMPLETED_WITH_ERRORS`. However, the task must reach a terminal state. If the task remains incomplete, the workflow waits until it reaches a terminal state before proceeding. | Optional. | 

</details>

## Task configuration

This is the task configuration for a Human task.

```json
   {
     "name": "human",
     "taskReferenceName": "human_ref",
     "inputParameters": {
       "__humanTaskDefinition": {
         "assignmentCompletionStrategy": "LEAVE_OPEN",
         "assignments": [
           {
             "assignee": {
               "user": "<ENGINEERS>",
               "userType": "CONDUCTOR_GROUP"
             },
             "slaMinutes": 10
           }
         ],
         "displayName": "Loan Approval",
         "userFormTemplate": {
           "name": "Approval",
           "version": 1
         },
         "autoClaim": true,
         "taskTriggers": [
           {
             "triggerType": "COMPLETED",
             "startWorkflowRequest": {
               "name": "email-notification-workflow",
               "version": 1
             }
           }
         ]
       }
     },
     "type": "HUMAN"
   }
```

## Task output

The Human task will return a JSON object containing the form response. For example:

```json
{
 "approve": "Yes",
 "comments": "Research paper approved.",
 "paperUrl": "<URL>"
}
```

## Adding a Human task in UI


**To add a Human task:**

1. In your workflow, select the **(+)** icon and add a **Human** task.
2. Enter the **Task display name**, which will appear on the connected UI for the user. Use a unique human-friendly name, such as “Loan Approval” or “Booking Form”.
3. Select the **User form template** previously created in Conductor and its Version.
4. (Optional) Add an **Assignment policy** to control who can fill out the form.
   1. In Assignment policy, select **(+) New assignment**.
   2. In Assign, select the **User type** for the assignee(s) and enter the corresponding user or group ID.
      - **External User** or **Group**—Select this if the assignees are managed and verified in an external system, and access an external UI to complete the task.
      - **Conductor User** or **Group**—Select this if the assignees are Conductor users, and use Conductor UI to complete the task.
   3. Enter the **SLA minutes** to specify the assignment duration before it times out. Use 0 minutes to set a non-expiring assignment.
   4. Select **Auto claim** if you want the first assignee in the list to automatically claim the Human task when it starts execution.
   5. In **After assignments**, select the strategy for when the assignment times out.
   6. If needed, add another assignment to create a multi-level assignment chain.
5. (Optional) Add a **Trigger policy** to start new workflows when the state of the Human task changes.
   1. In Trigger policy, select **(+) New trigger**.
   2. Select the **Trigger event**.
   3. Select the **Workflow** to start and its **Version**.
   4. (Optional) Select **Additional inputs** to configure the workflow’s input parameters, correlation ID, and task-to-domain mapping.
   5. If needed, add another trigger policy to start another workflow.
6. In **Input parameters**, configure the form fields depending on the input source:
   - If the field is to be filled up by the assignee, leave the value empty.
   - If the field is read-only, set the value explicitly. You can use static values or [dynamic variables](/content/developer-guides/passing-inputs-to-task-in-conductor) to pass data from workflow inputs or previous task outputs.

## Examples

Here are some examples for using the Human task.

<details>
<summary>Document approval</summary>

See an example of a [document approval workflow](https://orkes.io/content/templates/examples/document-approvals) in Orkes Conductor, where two reviewers evaluate a submission, and the workflow either sends an approval email or requests revisions based on their decisions.
