# Sub Workflow

The Sub Workflow task executes another workflow within the current workflow. This allows you to reuse common workflows across multiple workflows. Unlike the [Start Workflow](./start-workflow.mdx) task, the Sub Workflow task executes synchronously, meaning the parent workflow waits until the sub-workflow completes.

The Sub Workflow task can also be used to overcome the limitations of other tasks:

- Use it in a [Do While](./do-while) task to achieve nested Do While loops.
- Use it in a [Dynamic Fork](./dynamic-fork.mdx) task to execute more than one task in each fork.

## Task parameters

Configure these parameters for the Sub Workflow task.

| **inputParameter**                        | Defines the input parameters for the sub-workflow. Inputs can reference parent workflow input parameters or outputs from preceding tasks and are passed directly to the invoked sub-workflow. | Optional. |



:::note Notes

- If you are defining the sub-workflow’s input parameters from the parent workflow, you need to add them as an input parameter in the parent workflow and then call the same input parameters inside the sub-workflow definition.
- If an idempotency strategy is configured in the sub-workflow task configuration and no idempotency key is provided, the sub-workflow task will automatically inherit the idempotency key from its parent workflow.
- To retry a sub-workflow from a specific task, call the [rerun workflow API](https://orkes.io/content/reference-docs/api/workflow/rerun-workflow) for the sub-workflow execution ID and set `reRunFromTaskId` to the task execution ID. For example:
```json
 curl -X POST 'https://<YOUR-CONDUCTOR-CLUSTER>/api/workflow/<SUBWORKFLOW-EXECUTION-ID>/rerun' \
   -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   -d '{
    "reRunFromTaskId": "<TASK-EXECUTION-ID>"
  }' \
   -H 'x-authorization: <TOKEN>'
```
:::

The following are generic configuration parameters that can be applied to the task and are not specific to the Sub Workflow task.

<details>
<summary>Other generic parameters</summary>

Here are other parameters for configuring the task behavior.

| Parameter | Description | Required/ Optional | 
| --------- | ----------- | ----------------- | 
| optional | Whether the task is optional. <br/><br/>If set to`true`, any task failure is ignored, and the workflow continues with the task status updated to `COMPLETED_WITH_ERRORS`. However, the task must reach a terminal state. If the task remains incomplete, the workflow waits until it reaches a terminal state before proceeding. | Optional. |

## Task configuration

This is the task configuration for a Sub Workflow task.

```json
{
     "name": "sub_workflow",
     "taskReferenceName": "sub_workflow_ref",
     "inputParameters": {
       "someKey": "someValue"
     },
     "type": "SUB_WORKFLOW",
     "subWorkflowParam": {
       "name": "<SUB-WORKFLOW-NAME>",
       "version": 3,
       "priority": 5,
       "idempotencyKey": "someKey",
       "idempotencyStrategy": "RETURN_EXISTING",
       "taskToDomain": {
         "someTask": "someDomain"
       }
     }
}
```

## Task output

The Sub Workflow task will return the following parameters.

| Parameter     | Description                                                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| subWorkflowId | The execution ID of the sub-workflow.                                          |

In addition to the execution ID, the output of the sub-workflow itself is also included in the Sub Workflow task output.

## Adding a Sub Workflow task in UI

**To add a Sub Workflow task:**

1. In your workflow, select the **(+)** icon and add a **Sub Workflow** task.
2. Enter the **Workflow name** and **Version**.
   Once selected, the sub-workflow’s input parameters will automatically appear if there are any pre-defined ones.
3. If the workflow doesn’t have a pre-existing definition in Conductor, enter the definition in the **Workflow definition**.
4. (Optional) Enter the **Idempotency key** and select the **Idempotency strategy**.
5. (Optional) Add any additional **Input parameters** for the sub-workflow.
6. (Optional) Add **Task-to-domain** mapping for the sub-workflow tasks.

To view the sub-workflow tasks within the parent workflow, select **Expand** to display them in the visual diagram editor.

## Examples

Here are some examples for using the Sub Workflow task.

<details>
<summary>Using the Sub Workflow task in a workflow</summary>
<p>

This example demonstrates how to reuse a payment workflow within a larger subscription workflow by utilizing a Sub Workflow task.

Assume you have an existing workflow named `payment_for_subscription` that contains the payment logic for subscriptions. This workflow is relatively long and is used in multiple places.

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="/content/img/payment-sub-workflow-example.jpg"
    alt="Payment sub workflow"
    width="100%"
    height="auto"
    style={{ paddingBottom: 40, paddingTop: 40 }}
  />
</p>

Instead of copying the payment logic into every workflow that requires it, you can invoke it as a sub-workflow. This ensures that any updates to the payment workflow are automatically reflected wherever it is used.

In the subscription renewal workflow, the payment workflow is added as a Sub Workflow task. When the subscription renewal workflow runs, it executes the sub-workflow synchronously and waits for it to complete before continuing.

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="/content/img/payment-sub-workflow-in-main-workflow.png"
    alt="Payment workflow as sub-workflow in a subscription flow"
    width="90%"
    height="auto"
    style={{ paddingBottom: 40, paddingTop: 40 }}
  />
</p>

This approach enhances maintainability by centralizing payment logic within a single workflow across the organization.

<details>
<summary>Using the `workflowDefinition parameter`in a Sub Workflow task</summary>
<p>

This example demonstrates how to dynamically execute a workflow definition passed as an input, without requiring it to be registered on the **Workflow** > **Definitions** page.

In this example, the parent workflow uses a Sub Workflow task and passes the entire workflow definition as a variable (as workflow input). The sub-workflow definition includes a single-step workflow with an HTTP task.

**To create the parent workflow definition:**

1. Go to **Definitions** > **Workflow** from the left navigation menu on your Conductor cluster.
2. Select **+ Define workflow**.
3. In the **Code** tab, paste the following code:

```json
{
 "name": "SubWorkflowExample",
 "description": "Using the `workflowDefinition parameter` in a Sub Workflow task",
 "version": 1,
 "tasks": [
   {
     "name": "run_dynamic_subworkflow",
     "taskReferenceName": "run_dynamic_subworkflow_ref",
     "inputParameters": {},
     "type": "SUB_WORKFLOW",
     "subWorkflowParam": {
       "workflowDefinition": "${workflow.input.dynamicWorkflow}"
     }
   }
 ],
 "inputParameters": [
   "dynamicWorkflow"
 ],
 "schemaVersion": 2
}
```

4. Select **Save** > **Confirm**.

Run the workflow by dynamically passing the workflow definition. 

**To run the workflow:**

1. Go to the **Run** tab.
2. In **Input Params**, enter the following workflow definition:

```json
{
 "name": "WorkflowCalledAsSubWorkflow",
 "description": "Example",
 "version": 1,
 "tasks": [
   {
     "name": "http",
     "taskReferenceName": "http_ref",
     "type": "HTTP",
     "inputParameters": {
       "uri": "https://orkes-api-tester.orkesconductor.com/api",
       "method": "GET",
       "accept": "application/json",
       "contentType": "application/json",
       "encode": true
     }
   }
 ],
 "schemaVersion": 2
}
```

3. Select **Execute**.

On viewing the execution, verify that the workflow definition was correctly passed by inspecting the input of the Sub Workflow task.

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="/content/img/inspecting-sub-workflow-input.png"
    alt="Inspecting Sub Worlflow's input parameter"
    width="100%"
    height="auto"
    style={{ paddingBottom: 40, paddingTop: 40 }}
  />
</p>

Here, the workflow isn’t saved in your cluster but executes dynamically at runtime. You can view the sub-workflow execution from **Summary** > **Subworkflow ID**.

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="/content/img/sub-workflow-execution-id.png"
    alt="Viewing sub-workflow execution that was passed dynamically"
    width="100%"
    height="auto"
    style={{ paddingBottom: 40, paddingTop: 40 }}
  />
