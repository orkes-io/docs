# How to migrate Workflows/Tasks between different Environments in Conductor?

Certain situations may demand recreating the same workflows over and over in various environments. The process of workflow recreation is a time-consuming task. To tackle such scenarios, you can leverage Conductor's Metadata Migration.

Metadata Migration allows you to seamlessly migrate tasks/workflows between different environments, thereby facilitating the smooth running of your business operations. It comes into use in situations such as when a feature is to be tested before deploying it into production. So, once the feature is built, it can be moved from the development to the testing environment and later into the production environment.

This document deals with the steps involved in migrating tasks/workflows between different environments.

## Target Environment Setup

Let’s consider that you are migrating a workflow/task from **Environment A** to **Environment B**. Environments are nothing but different Conductor servers.

Initially, you need to include the target environment details (the environment to which the workflow is being migrated to) in your current environment. Here, your current environment is A, and the workflow is being migrated to the target environment B.

Before beginning with the environment creation, you need to add the token of the target environment as a [Secret](https://orkes.io/content/docs/how-tos/Workflows/create-secrets) in environment A.

### Storing Token as a Secret

In your Environment A,

1. Navigate to **MORE > Secrets** and click **Add Secret**.
2. You need to fill in the following fields:
   - **Secret Name** - Provide a name to identify your secret.
   - **Secret Value** - Provide the API Token of the target environment.

To get the API token from the target environment:

1. Navigate to **ACCESS CONTROL > Applications**, and click **Create Application**.
2. Provide a name to identify your application and click **Create**.
3. Open the created application (You can click on the edit icon near the application).
4. Grant the Metadata Manager access to it from **Unrestricted Roles > Metadata Manager**.
5. Create an access key for the application by clicking **Create Access Key**. Ensure to copy the key ID and key secret.
6. Make a request to POST /api/token with the access key to obtain a token. This token is to be given under the field **Secret Value** mentioned above.

Note: For a quick testing, you can use the user’s personal token, as explained below. However, it may grant too many permissions, and the token expires in a few hours. So, it is recommended to use this method for quick testing purposes only.

- To copy the token, click on the drop-down option near your profile icon in Environment B.
- Copy the token. This token is to be given under the field **Secret Value**.

Note that the key is copied from Environment B and pasted as a secret in Environment A.

### Creating Environment

In your current environment, i.e., Environment A,

1. From the left menu, navigate to **METADATA MIGRATION > Environments**.
2. Click **New Environment**.

3. You need to fill in the following fields:
   - **Environment Id** - Provide a name to identify the environment.
   - **Token (secret)** - Choose the previously added secret here.
   - **URI** - Provide the conductor server URI of Environment B.
4. Click **Add**.

## Creating a Migration Request

The next step is creating a migration request.

1. Navigate to **METADATA MIGRATION > Migration Request**.
2. Under **Target Environment**, choose the environment you’ve created previously.
3. Select the workflows and tasks to be migrated.
4. Click **Create Migration**.

<center><img src="/content/img/creating-migration-request.jpg" alt="Creating a migration request" width="90%" height="auto" style={{paddingBottom: 40, paddingTop: 40}} /></center>

5. An outgoing-migration-request workflow is created. Click on the Workflow ID to view the Workflow status.
6. The outgoing migration request workflow should be completed if the configurations are correct.

## Verifying Migration Request

Once your migration request is successfully completed in Environment A, you can verify the incoming migration request in Environment B.

1. In Environment B, navigate to **WORKFLOWS > Executions**. You can view your incoming migration request workflow on the executions page. Click on the workflow ID to view the workflow.
2. Once the incoming migration request is successfull, go to **WORKFLOWS > Definitions** in Environment B and verify that your migrated workflow has been listed here.

3. Similarly, you can also verify the task migration from the **Task Definitions** page.
