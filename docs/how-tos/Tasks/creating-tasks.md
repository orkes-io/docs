# Creating Task Definitions

## Creating a task

Tasks can be created using the tasks metadata API:

```http request
POST /api/metadata/taskdefs
```

This API takes an array of new task definitions.

## Using Orkes Cloud

## Parameters in task creation

Here are the fields used to define the task:

### Retry Logic

- FIXED: Reschedule the task after the `retryDelaySeconds`
- EXPONENTIAL_BACKOFF: Reschedule after `retryDelaySeconds  * 2^(attemptNumber)`

### Timeout Policy

- RETRY: Retries the task again
- TIME_OUT_WF: Workflow is marked as TIMED_OUT and terminated
- ALERT_ONLY: Registers a counter (task_timeout)

> Note: To create a task that never times out, set `timeoutSeconds` to 0 and the `pollTimeoutSeconds` to 0.

### Task Concurrent Execution Limits

- `concurrentExecLimit` limits the number of simultaneous task executions at any point.  
  **Example:**  
  If you have 1000 task executions waiting in the queue and 1000 workers polling this queue for tasks, but if you have set `concurrentExecLimit` to 10, only 10 tasks would be given to workers (which would lead to starvation). If any of the workers finish execution, a new task(s) will be removed from the queue while keeping the current execution count to 10.

### Task Rate limits

> Note: Rate limiting is only supported for the Redis-persistence module and is not available with other persistence layers.

- `rateLimitFrequencyInSeconds` and `rateLimitPerFrequency` should be used together.
- `rateLimitFrequencyInSeconds` sets the "frequency window", i.e., the `duration` to be used in `events per duration`. Eg: 1s, 5s, 60s, 300s etc.
- `rateLimitPerFrequency`defines the number of tasks that can be given to Workers per given "frequency window".  
  **Example:**  
  Let's set `rateLimitFrequencyInSeconds = 5` and `rateLimitPerFrequency = 12`. This means our frequency window is of 5 seconds duration, and for each frequency window, Conductor would only give 12 tasks to workers. So, in a given minute, Conductor would only give 12\*(60/5) = 144 tasks to workers irrespective of the number of workers polling for the task.  
  Note that, unlike `concurrentExecLimit`, rate limiting doesn't take into account tasks already in progress/completed. Even if all the previous tasks are executed within 1 sec or would take a few days, the new tasks are still given to workers at configured frequency, 144 tasks per minute in the above example.

### Using inputKeys and outputKeys

- `inputKeys` and `outputKeys` can be considered as parameters and return values for the task.
- Consider the task definition as being represented by an interface: `(value1, value2 .. valueN) someTaskDefinition(key1, key2 .. keyN);`
- However, these parameters are not strictly enforced at the moment. Both `inputKeys` and `outputKeys` act as documentation for task re-use. The tasks in the workflow need not define all the keys in the task definition.
- In the future, this can be extended to be a strict template that all task implementations must adhere to, just like interfaces in programming languages.

### Using inputTemplate

- `inputTemplate` allows to define default values, which can be overridden by values provided in workflow.
- Eg: In your Task Definition, you can define your inputTemplate as:

```json
"inputTemplate": {
    "url": "https://some_url:7004"
}
```

- Now, in your workflow definition, when using the above task, you can use the default `url` or override with something else in the task's `inputParameters`.

```json
"inputParameters": {
    "url": "${workflow.input.some_new_url}"
}
```

## Examples

### Example using curl

```shell
curl 'http://localhost:8080/api/metadata/taskdefs' \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '[{"createdBy":"user","name":"sample_task_name_1","description":"This is a sample task for demo","responseTimeoutSeconds":10,"timeoutSeconds":30,"inputKeys":[],"outputKeys":[],"timeoutPolicy":"TIME_OUT_WF","retryCount":3,"retryLogic":"FIXED","retryDelaySeconds":5,"inputTemplate":{},"rateLimitPerFrequency":0,"rateLimitFrequencyInSeconds":1}]'
```

Here's the JSON in the curl body (for better readability):

```json
{
  "createdBy": "user",
  "name": "sample_task_name_1",
  "description": "This is a sample task for demo",
  "responseTimeoutSeconds": 10,
  "timeoutSeconds": 30,
  "inputKeys": [],
  "outputKeys": [],
  "timeoutPolicy": "TIME_OUT_WF",
  "retryCount": 3,
  "retryLogic": "FIXED",
  "retryDelaySeconds": 5,
  "inputTemplate": {},
  "rateLimitPerFrequency": 0,
  "rateLimitFrequencyInSeconds": 1
}
```

### Example using node fetch

> Note that all the quotes in the body must be escaped.

```javascript
fetch("http://localhost:8080/api/metadata/taskdefs", {
  headers: {
    accept: "*/*",
    "content-type": "application/json",
  },
  body: '[{"createdBy":"user","name":"sample_task_name_1","description":"This is a sample task for demo","responseTimeoutSeconds":10,"timeoutSeconds":30,"inputKeys":[],"outputKeys":[],"timeoutPolicy":"TIME_OUT_WF","retryCount":3,"retryLogic":"FIXED","retryDelaySeconds":5,"inputTemplate":{},"rateLimitPerFrequency":0,"rateLimitFrequencyInSeconds":1}]',
  method: "POST",
});
```

## Best Practices

1. You can update a set of tasks together in this API.
2. Task configurations are important attributes that control the behavior of this task in a Workflow. Refer to [Task Configurations](https://orkes.io/content/docs/how-tos/Tasks/task-configurations) for all the options and details.
3. You can also use the Conductor Swagger UI to update the tasks.
