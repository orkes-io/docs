# Task Timeouts

Tasks can be configured to handle various scenarios of timeouts. Here are some scenarios and the relevant configuration
fields.

| Scenario                                                                                                   | Configuration            |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| A task worker picked up the task but failed to respond back with an update                                 | `responseTimeoutSeconds` |
| A task worker picks up the task and updates progress but fails to complete it within an expected timeframe | `timeoutSeconds`         |
| A task is stuck in a retry loop with repeated failures beyond an expected timeframe                        | `timeoutSeconds`         |
| A task doesn't get picked by any workers for a specific amount of time                                     | `pollTimeoutSeconds`     |
| The task isn't completed within a specified amount of time despite being picked up by task workers         | `timeoutSeconds`         |

> `timeoutSeconds` should always be greater than `responseTimeoutSeconds`

### Timeout Seconds

```json
"timeoutSeconds" : 30
```

When configured with a value > `0`, the system will wait for this task to complete successfully until this number of
seconds from when the task is first polled. We can use this to fail a workflow when a task breaches the overall SLA for
completion.

### Response Timeout Seconds

```json
"responseTimeoutSeconds" : 10
```

When configured with a value > `0`, the system will wait for this number of seconds from when the task is polled before
the worker updates back with a status. The worker can keep the task in `IN_PROGRESS` state if it requires more time to
complete.

### Poll Timeout Seconds

```json
"pollTimeoutSeconds" : 10
```

When configured with a value > `0`, the system will wait for this number of seconds for the task to be picked up by a
task worker. Useful when you want to detect a backlogged task queue with not enough workers.
