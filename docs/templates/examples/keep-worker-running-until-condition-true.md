# Running a Worker Until Condition is met

## Introduction - Custom Poll Worker

We can use a worker and keep it running until a condition is met. This is similar to the [HTTP Poll](/content/reference-docs/system-tasks/http-poll) task, where
you can poll an HTTP endpoint until a specific condition is met. Having a worker do the same is useful
when you don't have an endpoint to call directly from Conductor.

## Code Sample


```java dynamic https://github.com/conductor-sdk/orkes-java-springboot2-example/blob/main/src/main/java/io/orkes/example/banking/workers/PollUntilConditionMeetsWorker.java section=1 ../workers/PollUntilConditionMeetsWorker.java
```

In this example worker, we use the `callbackAfterSeconds` attribute to keep the worker in progress
until a condition is met. This can be any arbitrary condition that our code defines.

Specifically, this example waits for the poll count to reach the input parameter `pollCounter`.

When you return a task as `IN_PROGRESS` with a `callbackAfterSeconds` value set, Conductor
will schedule the same task instance to be polled exactly after the `callbackAfterSeconds` value.

We are leveraging the output data to hold the context across polls, and once it reaches the desired state, we exit `IN_PROGRESS`
and mark the task as `COMPLETED`.

Go ahead and try [this worker](https://developers.orkes.cloud/workflowDef/poll-until-condition-workflow) in a workflow in our Developer Edition environment. We have already configured this in our sandbox, so it should run when you test.

:::tip Language agnostic
Such workers can be implemented in any of the languages.
