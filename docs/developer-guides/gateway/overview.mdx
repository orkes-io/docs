# MCP/API Gateway

Orkes Conductor’s MCP/API Gateway lets you expose any workflow as APIs or MCP tools. The gateway enables you to expose a workflow so that it can be called by either traditional API clients or AI agents that support the Model Context Protocol. 

With this, you can:

* Expose workflows as APIs
* Expose APIs as MCP tools 

## API Gateway: Expose workflows as APIs 

Use the API Gateway when you want client applications to call workflows through standard API requests. This is suitable for backend systems, UI applications, and integrations that require REST-style interfaces.

Each route becomes an HTTP endpoint. When a request is made to the endpoint, Conductor runs the workflow mapped to the route and returns the workflow output as the API response.

## MCP Gateway: Expose APIs as MCP tools 

Use the MCP Gateway when you want AI agents to call APIs through the Model Context Protocol. This is suitable for systems like Claude and other MCP-compatible tools that invoke structured actions as part of their reasoning.

Each MCP service exposes routes as tools. When an AI agent calls a tool, Conductor runs the workflow mapped to the route and returns the workflow output as a structured MCP response.
