# MCP Gateway:  Expose Workflows as MCP tools 

Using Conductor’s MCP Gateway, you can expose any workflows as MCP tools for AI agents. Each MCP tool corresponds to a workflow that can perform multi-step operations, coordinate internal systems, and return structured output that AI agents can understand and process. This design allows agents to trigger business actions without manual intervention.

MCP tools are defined as **routes** within a **service**. Each route is associated with a workflow that runs when an agent submits a tool request through the Model Context Protocol. **Authentication settings** determine which clients can invoke MCP tools and how they are authorized.

Here’s an overview of how to expose APIs as MCP services in Conductor:

1. Create workflows that represent the actions your AI agents will perform
2. Create an application with permission to execute the workflows. This is the service account layer.
3. Configure authentication settings for the MCP service.
4. Define an MCP service.
5. Define and test routes.
6. Connect the service with AI agents as an MCP tool.

## Step 1: Create workflows that define tool behavior

The MCP Gateway allows you to expose Conductor workflows as APIs that can be called by an MCP tool. Before defining any MCP routes, ensure that the workflows implementing your endpoint logic are already created.

You can [create workflows](https://orkes.io/content/developer-guides/workflows#ways-to-create-workflows) using the Conductor UI, APIs, or SDKs.

## Step 2: Create an application in Orkes Conductor

[An application in Orkes Conductor](https://orkes.io/content/access-control-and-security/applications) serves as the identity that the MCP Gateway uses when executing workflows on behalf of the AI agent.

**To create an application:**

1. Go to **Access Control** > **Applications**, and select **+ Create application**.
2. Enter a name for the application.
3. (Optional) Enable the required **Application role** based on how the service wants to interact with the application.
4. In **Permissions**, select **+ Add permission**.
5. In the **Workflow** tab, select the workflow created in [Step 1](/content/developer-guides/mcp-gateway#step-1-create-workflows-that-define-tool-behavior) and enable **EXECUTE** permission.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/dev-guides/gateway/create-application-mcp-gateway.png" alt="Create application in Orkes Conductor" width="100%" height="auto"/></p>

6. Save the application.

## Step 3: Configure authentication settings

Authentication controls how external agent systems connect to your MCP tools. You can configure these settings at the cluster level and reuse them across multiple services in the MCP Gateway.

**To configure authentication settings:**

1. Go to **APIs** > **Authentication** from the left navigation menu on your Conductor cluster.
2. Select **+ New authentication**. 
3. Configure the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Required/Optional | 
| --------- | ----------- | ----------------- | 
| ID | A unique identifier for the authentication configuration. This cannot be renamed once saved. | Required. | 
| Authentication Type | The type of authentication to use. Supported values:<ul><li>**API Key**–Enforces basic authentication using an API key.</li><li>**Public**–No authentication is enforced, and the API will be accessible to anyone.</li></ul> | Required. | 
| API Key | The API key for authentication. A random key is generated by default. You can also select **Generate** to create one instantly. Copy and store the key securely for future authentication. | Required if *Authentication Type* is *API Key*. | 
| Application | Select the application created in [Step 2](/content/developer-guides/mcp-gateway#step-2-create-an-application-in-orkes-conductor), which generates an access key and JWT token. The MCP Gateway will use this token to authenticate with the Conductor. The service using this authentication will inherit the application’s permissions. | Required. | 

4. Select **Save**.

## Step 4: Define an MCP service

A **service** is a logical container for MCP endpoints, referred to as **routes**. Routes within a service inherit common settings, including the base path, authentication configuration, and CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policies. Each route maps to a workflow that the MCP Gateway invokes when the endpoint is called. You must create a service before you can add routes to it.

**To define a service:**

1. Go to **APIs** > **Services** from the left navigation menu on your Conductor cluster.
2. Select **+ New service**.
3. Configure the following parameters:

3. Select **Save**. 

### Test a route

You can test route behavior directly from the Conductor UI before exposing it as an MCP tool.

#### Run a test request

**To test a route:**

1. Go to the **APIs** > **Services**, and select the service.
2. In **Routes**, select the play icon next to the route to test.
3. In **Path Parameters**, enter any required parameters for the endpoint.
4. (If Authentication is using an API key) Replace *** with the API key copied in [Step 3](/content/developer-guides/mcp-gateway#step-3-configure-authentication-settings).
5. In **Body**, enter the request payload as expected by the workflow.
6. Select **Test Route**.
7. Review the **Response** to verify the route works as expected. 

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/dev-guides/gateway/testing-route.gif" alt="Testing a route" width="100%" height="auto"/></p>

#### Verify workflow execution

**To confirm that the route triggered the workflow:**

1. Go to **Executions** > **Workflow** in your Conductor cluster and verify that the workflow is completed successfully.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/dev-guides/gateway/workflow-triggered-by-mcp-gateway.png" alt="Workflow triggered by the route" width="100%" height="auto"/></p>

2. Select the **Workflow ID** to view the complete execution, including the workflow input and output.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/dev-guides/gateway/workflow-execution-triggered-by-mcp-gateway.png" alt="Workflow triggered by the route" width="100%" height="auto"/></p>

#### View endpoint details

**To get the cURL command:**

1. Go to **APIs** > **Services**, and select your service. 
2. Select a route to open its details. 
3. You can get the cURL command for the actual endpoint here.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/dev-guides/gateway/curl.png" alt="Curl command for API" width="100%" height="auto"/></p>

**To view the OpenAPI documentation for the endpoint:**

1. Go to **APIs** > **Services**, and select the service. 
2. In **Metadata & Resources**, select **View API documentation**.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/dev-guides/gateway/openapi-doc-mcp-gateway.jpg" alt="OpenAPI documentation for the APIs" width="100%" height="auto"/></p>

## Step 6: Connect the service with AI agents as an MCP tool

Next, you can connect this MCP service to your preferred AI tool as an MCP tool. You need the MCP endpoint URL for this.

**To get the MCP tool endpoint:**

1. Go to **APIs** > **Services**, and select the service.
2. In **Configuration**, copy the **MCP Tool Remote Endpoint**.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/dev-guides/gateway/mcp-endpoint.png" alt="MCP Tool endpoint" width="100%" height="auto"/></p>

Use this as the MCP server endpoint when you configure your AI tool.

For example, you can use tools like [MCP Inspecto](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) for testing and debugging your MCP endpoints before integrating them with an AI tool.

### Verify using MCP Inspector

**To test the endpoint in MCP Inspector:**

1. [Install MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector).
2. Run MCP Inspector in UI mode using the following command:

```shell
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

The server will start, and the UI will be accessible at http://localhost:6274.

3. In **Transport Type**, select **Streamable HTTP**.
4. In **URL**, enter the **MCP Tool Remote Endpoint** copied from Conductor.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/dev-guides/gateway/mcp-inspector-ui.png" alt="MCP Inspector UI" width="100%" height="auto"/></p>

5. Leave authentication empty if the service uses Public authentication. If the service requires authentication, provide the required key.
6. Select **Connect**.

If the connection is successful, the tools become visible.

7. Select **List Tools** to view the available tools.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/dev-guides/gateway/api-listed-as-mcp-tool.png" alt="APIs listed as MCP tools" width="100%" height="auto"/></p>

Each route in the service appears as an MCP tool. You can select a tool, provide input, and call it directly from the Inspector.

Each tool call triggers the workflow mapped to that route. This validation step helps ensure that your MCP service is correctly configured before connecting it to an AI agent.
