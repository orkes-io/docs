# Using Environment Variables

In Orkes Conductor, environment variables help manage frequently used values across multiple workflows. By storing these variables globally in Conductor, you can reuse them in workflows to improve efficiency and maintainability.

## Creating environment variables

**To create an environment variable:**

1. Go to **Definitions** > **Environment Variables** from the left navigation menu on the Conductor cluster.
2. Select **+ New environment variable**.
3. Enter the following details:
  - **Name**–A unique identifier for the variable. This name will be used to reference the variable in workflow definitions.
  - **Value**–The value to be stored as the variable.
  - **Value Type**–Select *Plain Text* or *JSON*.
4. Select **Add** to save the variable.

### Using environment variables in workflow

To use an environment variable in a workflow, use the following expression:

```
${workflow.env.variable-name}
```
Replace *variable-name* with the actual environment variable name. This expression dynamically retrieves the variable during workflow execution.

## Updating environment variables

**To update an environment variable:**

1. Go to **Definitions** > **Environment Variables**, and select the variable to update.
2. In **Value**, enter the updated variable.
3. Select **Edit** to confirm.

## Sample Workflow

<details>
<summary>Using environment variables in a workflow</summary>
<p>

To illustrate the use of environment variables in a workflow, consider the following variable stored in Orkes Conductor.

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="/content/img/sample-environment-variable.png"
    alt="Sample environment variable"
    width="50%"
    height="auto"
  ></img>
</p>

The following example defines a workflow that references the stored environment variable:

```json
{
  "name": "sample-workflow",
  "description": "Workflow to demonstrate passing variables through environment variables",
  "version": 1,
  "tasks": [
    {
      "name": "http",
      "taskReferenceName": "http_ref",
      "inputParameters": {
        "uri": "${workflow.env.sample-url}",
        "method": "GET",
        "connectionTimeOut": 3000,
        "readTimeOut": "3000",
        "accept": "application/json",
        "contentType": "application/json",
        "encode": true
      },
      "type": "HTTP"
    }
  ],
  "schemaVersion": 2,
  "ownerEmail": "name@example.com"
}
```

When this workflow runs, the expression `${workflow.env.sample-url}` is dynamically replaced with the actual variable value, provided that the user running the workflow has permission to access the variable.
To verify that the stored variable is passed correctly, go to the workflow execution page, select the HTTP task, and check the **Input**.
