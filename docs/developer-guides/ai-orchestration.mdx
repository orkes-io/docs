# AI Orchestration 

Orkes Conductor provides features to build applications that use AI models and vector databases in workflows. These applications can range from simple AI-powered tasks to agentic workflows where decisions are made dynamically based on model output.

Key features include:

* **AI Tasks**: Use predefined system tasks to generate text, create embeddings, and retrieve results from vector databases.
* **AI/LLM and Vector Database Integrations**: Connect to multiple AI models and vector databases in a secure, governed way.
* **AI Prompt Studio**: Create, refine, test, and govern prompt templates for AI models.

You can use these features to build:

* AI agents or agentic workflows
* RAG (retrieval augmented generation) systems
* LLM-powered chatbots

## Orchestrating AI-powered tasks

Orkes Conductor provides a variety of AI tasks that can execute common logic without the need to write code. Depending on the task type, these tasks may require an AI/LLM integration, a vector database integration, or an AI prompt.
