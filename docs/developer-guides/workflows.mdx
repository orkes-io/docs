# Overview: Workflows

A workflow coordinates tasks to execute business logic. In Conductor, you can build workflows for process automation, event-driven processing, agentic orchestration, microservice orchestration, real-time API orchestration, and human approval flows.

A workflow defines how tasks run, in what order, and under which conditions. Conductor manages task execution, retries, state, and failure handling so you can focus on business logic instead of orchestration code.

## Ways to create workflows

In Conductor, all workflows are stored and executed as JSON workflow definitions. You can create a workflow using any of the following methods:

1. **Code**: Using Conductor SDKs, define the workflow in any programming language (Python, Java, JavaScript, C#, Go, Clojure) and register it with the Conductor server. Once registered, Conductor generates and saves the JSON workflow definition. Learn more in [Write Workflows as Code](/content/developer-guides/write-workflows-using-code).
2. **API**: Write the workflow in JSON and register it to the Conductor server using the [`/api/metadata/workflow`](/reference-docs/api/metadata/creating-workflow-definition) endpoint.
3. **Conductor UI**: Using the Conductor UI, you can design workflows in two ways:
    - [**Visual workflow builder**](/content/developer-guides/build-workflows-using-ui#create-workflows-using-visual-workflow-builder): Define your workflow visually, which is formatted as JSON under the hood.
    - [**Assistant**](/content/developer-guides/build-workflows-using-ui#using-assistant): Use a prompt-based interface to create workflows by describing them in natural language. The assistant generates the workflow definition for you.
4. **BPMN importer**: [Convert existing BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) files into Conductor workflows](/content/developer-guides/convert-bpmn-to-workflows) using the built-in importer. This provides an easy migration path from BPMN-based systems.

### Static vs dynamic workflows

You can create workflows statically (ahead of time) or dynamically (at runtime). Dynamic workflows are created using the workflow-as-code approach, allowing you to write your workflow and task workers in your preferred language and execute them immediately. This is useful when you can't define workflows ahead of time because the number of tasks and flow control depend on real-time factors. Learn more in [Write Workflows as Code](write-workflows-using-code).

### AI-powered and agentic workflows

Agentic workflows use AI-driven decision-making to determine which tasks to execute and when. Task execution can adapt dynamically with minimal human intervention while still allowing oversight when required.

Conductor’s AI orchestration capabilities let you build agentic workflows that are auditable, scalable, and safe to operate in production environments. Learn more in [AI Orchestration and Agentic Workflows](/content/ai-orchestration). 

### Human in the loop

Human-in-the-loop workflows include tasks that require manual input, review, or approval. These workflows combine automated steps with human decision points, making them suitable for approval flows, exception handling, and review-based processes. Learn more in [Human Task Orchestration](/content/developer-guides/orchestrating-human-tasks).

### Event-driven workflows

Event-driven workflows start or progress based on external events. Conductor supports event-driven patterns through features such as webhooks, event handlers, and message broker integrations. Learn more in [Eventing](/content/eventing). 

### Gateway

You can expose and trigger Conductor workflows through the Gateway, enabling workflows to act as real-time APIs or Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools.  Learn more in [Gateway](/content/developer-guides/mcp-api-gateway).

### Remote Services

Remote services provide a centralized way to define and manage HTTP and gRPC endpoints that can be reused across workflows.  Learn more in [Remote Services](/content/remote-services).

## Workflow definition

A workflow definition contains configuration parameters that define the workflow behavior, including the flow of tasks, workflow inputs and outputs, schema, failure handling settings, and rate-limiting features. The most important parameter is the `tasks` array, which specifies the order and execution of the defined tasks and operators.

Here are the workflow configuration parameters:

| Parameter                     | Description                                                                     | Required/ Optional              |
