# Running Workflows

You can run Conductor workflows during development, testing, and production. Choose the method that best fits your use case:

- For manual testing and debugging, use the Conductor UI
- For production environments, use the Conductor APIs or SDKs
- For recurring flows, use schedules
- For event-driven workflows, use webhooks or message brokers

| Method | Description | Related documentation | 
| ------ | ----------- | --------------------- | 
| Conductor UI| Run workflows manually during development and testing. The UI lets you provide input parameters and view execution results in real time. | [Run workflows from the UI](/content/how-to-videos/run-workflow) | 
| Conductor APIs | Run workflows programmatically in two ways: asynchronously to start a workflow without waiting for it to complete, or synchronously to start a workflow and wait for its output. | <ul><li>[Start workflow execution (asynchronous)](/content/reference-docs/api/workflow/start-workflow-execution)</li><li>[Start workflow execution (synchronous)](/content/reference-docs/api/workflow/synchronous-workflow-execution)</li></ul> | 
| Conductor SDKs (Workflow as code) | Define and run workflows directly in your application code. Ideal for dynamic workflow orchestration. | [Using Conductor SDKs](/content/category/sdks) | 
| Schedules | Automate workflow runs on a defined interval using cron expressions. | [Schedule workflows](/content/developer-guides/scheduling-workflows) |
| Webhooks | Trigger workflows automatically in response to webhook requests from external systems. | [Trigger workflows from webhooks](/content/developer-guides/webhook-integration) | 
| Events | Start workflows in response to events from message brokers. | [Run workflows from events](/content/developer-guides/event-handler) |
