# Running Workflows

You can run a Conductor workflow in several ways:

| Method | Description | Learn more | 
| ------ | ----------- | ---------- | 
| From the Conductor UI | Run workflows manually during development and testing. The UI lets you provide input parameters and view execution results in real time. | [Run workflows from UI](/content/how-to-videos/run-workflow). | 
| Using Conductor APIs | Run workflows programmatically in two ways: asynchronously to start a workflow without waiting for it to complete, or synchronously to start a workflow and wait for its output. | <ul><li>[Start Workflow Execution (Asynchronous)](https://orkes.io/content/reference-docs/api/workflow/start-workflow-execution)</li><li>[Start Workflow Execution (Synchronous)](https://orkes.io/content/reference-docs/api/workflow/synchronous-workflow-execution)</li></ul> | 
| Using Conductor SDKs (workflow as code) | Define and run workflows directly in your application code. Ideal for dynamic workflow orchestration. | [Using Conductor SDKs](/content/category/sdks). | 
| Using a schedule | Automate workflow runs on a defined interval using cron expressions. | [Schedule workflows](/content/developer-guides/scheduling-workflows). |
| From a webhook | Trigger workflows automatically in response to webhook requests from external systems. | [Trigger workflows from webhooks](/content/developer-guides/webhook-integration). | 
| From an event | Start workflows in response to events from message brokers. | [Run workflows from events](/content/developer-guides/event-handler). |
