# Managing Workflow Versions

In Orkes Conductor, you can create, edit, run, and delete workflow versions. Each workflow can have multiple versions, allowing you to evolve workflows safely over time.

## Creating new workflow versions

By default, the workflow version starts from 1 and increments with each new version.

``` json
{
  "name": "newWorkflow",
  "description": "Sample Description",
  "version": 1,
  "tasks": [
    //list of tasks
   ]
}
```

**To create a new version:**

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Using workflow JSON" label="Using workflow JSON">

Increment the version number in the JSON code and save the workflow.

```json
{
  "name": "newWorkflow",
  "description": "Sample Description",
  "version": <VERSION-NUMBER>,
  "tasks": [
    //list of tasks
   ]
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Using Conductor UI" label="Using Conductor UI">

After making changes to the workflow definition in the Conductor UI, select the ⏷ (down arrow) icon beside Save > **Save as new version** to create a new version. The keyboard shortcut is **Ctrl**+**S**+**N**.

You can view all versions of a workflow in **Definitions** > **Workflow** using the version dropdown in the visual workflow editor.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Editing workflow versions

Each workflow version can be edited and saved separately, allowing you to update and run multiple versions of the same workflow in production.

**To edit a previous workflow version:**
1. Go to **Definitions** > **Workflow** and select the desired workflow.
2. From the version dropdown in the top right corner, select the desired version.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/viewing-different-workflow-versions.png" alt="Screenshot of the Orkes Conductor UI, showing the version dropdown view in the visual workflow builder." width="80%" height="auto"></img></p>

3. Make the required changes and save.

## Running workflow versions

When running a workflow, you can specify which version to execute. If no version is specified, the latest version runs by default.

**To run a workflow from its workflow definition:**

1. Select the required workflow version from the version dropdown.
2. Select **Execute**.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/run-workflow-from-definitions-page.gif" alt="Running workflows from a workflow definition page" width="100%" height="auto"></img></p>

**To run workflows the from workflow executions/definitions page:**

1. Go to **Executions** > **Workflow** or **Definitions** > **Workflow**.
2. Select **Run Workflow** from the top-right corner.
3. Select the **Workflow name** and **Version**.
4. Select **Run Workflow**.

## Deleting workflow versions

You can delete workflow versions that are no longer needed. All currently running executions for the deleted version will continue to completion, but no new executions can be invoked. All new versions added afterward will continue incrementing from the latest version.

**To delete a workflow version:**
1. Go to **Definitions** > **Workflow** and select the desired workflow.
2. From the version dropdown in the top-right corner, select the version to delete.
3. Select **Delete** > **Confirm**.
