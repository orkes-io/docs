# Conductor Playground

Get started with [Orkes Playground](https://play.orkes.io) by creating a free account.

## What is Conductor Playground?

[Conductor Playground](https://play.orkes.io) is a free environment for developers to try out and explore more about Conductor. It is fully hosted by Orkes and is run as a multi-tenant cluster. Developers can use Playground to get familiarized with what Conductor offers and it is NOT intended for running production workflows. For running Conductor orchestration & workflows in production, we recommend the following:

- [Orkes Cloud](https://orkes.io/cloud/) - A fully managed and hosted Conductor cluster deployed to your cloud. It comes with free and paid plans!
- The [open-source](https://github.com/Netflix/conductor) version of Conductor.

## Logging in to Conductor Playground

1. Navigate to [Orkes Playground](https://play.orkes.io/) and click **Login to Continue**.
2. Click on **Signup** and follow the on-screen instructions to set up your account. Alternatively, you can click **Continue with Google** to authenticate using your Google account.
3. The landing page is a list of workflow executions on the playground. If this is your first login, this table will be empty.

## Conductor Playground Components

Let’s look in detail at what each section of the playground defines.

The left navigation gives an insight into the major components of the Conductor.

## Preinstalled Workflows

The Playground comes pre-installed with many workflows to get to the action right away with Conductor. These can be executed from within the UI.

> **Note:** Please note that the executions of these pre-installed workflows are shared across all Playground users, and as such, it is not recommended to use any input data or correlation id strings that you want to keep private.

### Sample Workflow Execution in Playground ​

In the **Workflow Definitions** section, you can see a **PopulationMinMax** workflow. Clicking on the workflow name will show the JSON definition and the visualization of the workflow.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/PopMinMax.png" alt="PopulationMaxMin Workflow" width="90%" height="auto" style={{paddingBottom: 40, paddingTop: 40}} /></p>

This workflow requires no input from the user. On execution, it will:

- Make an HTTP request to retrieve US state populations.
- Split into two parallel tasks:
  - Find the state with the highest population.
  - Find the state with the lowest population.
- Rejoin, combine the results and exit.

Test this workflow in real-time:

1. Click the **Run Workflow** button in the left navigation. Select **PopulationMinMax** from the dropdown _Workflow Name_, and click **Run Workflow**.
<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/run-workflow-popminmax.png" alt="Running the PopMaxMin workflow" width="90%" height="auto" style={{paddingBottom: 40, paddingTop: 40}} /></p>
2. Click on the Workflow ID generated, and you'll see that the workflow has probably been completed.
<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/popminmax-workflow-completed.png" alt="PopMaxMin workflow completed" width="90%" height="auto" style={{paddingBottom: 40, paddingTop: 40}} /></p>
3. Explore with the UI to investigate each task in the diagram, or hit Workflow Input/Output to see the result of the workflow.

## Create New Workflow​

You can use Playground to create new workflows and execute them. These will be private and visible only to you. Follow our tutorial on how to [create your first workflow in the Playground](https://orkes.io/content/docs/getting-started/playground/first-playground-application).
