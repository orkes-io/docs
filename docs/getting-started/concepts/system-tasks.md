# System Task

System tasks/Workers are built-in tasks that run on the Conductor servers. They are general-purpose and reusable tasks, and can be implemented faster when compared to user-defined tasks because there isn’t a need to write a custom worker.

## Supported System Tasks

Conductor has the following set of system tasks available.
