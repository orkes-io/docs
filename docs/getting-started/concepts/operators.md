# Operators

Operators in Conductor are the built-in primitives that allow you to define the control flow in the workflow. They are similar to programming constructs such as for loops, switch cases, etc. Conductor offers support for most of the programming primitives allowing you to define the most advanced workflows.

## Supported Operators
Conductor supports the following programming language constructs:
