# Access Control Management

Your Conductor server may run in a different hosted environment than your workers. The APIs to control, run or edit your workflows shouldnâ€™t be exposed on the internet and therefore needs to restrict access.

In order to ensure that all workflow executions & worker tasks are run only by authorized users, Orkes has added a security layer defined as **Access Control** to all parts of the workflow orchestration lifecycle.

The security aspect of this feature can be mainly categorized into the following three categories:

- [Applications](https://orkes.io/content/docs/getting-started/concepts/access-control-applications)
- [Users and Groups](https://orkes.io/content/docs/getting-started/concepts/access-control-users)
- [Tags](https://orkes.io/content/docs/getting-started/concepts/access-control-tags)
