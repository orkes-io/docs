# Workers and Tasks
  
## Worker
A worker is responsible for executing a task.  Operators and System tasks are handled by the Conductor server, whereas the user-defined tasks need to have a worker running in a different environment.  This worker will poll Conductor's task queue to see if any work has been scheduled by the server. If there is a scheduled task, the worker executes the task and produces the output, provided input has been specified. The workerâ€™s output is sent back to the workflow and the process continues as per the defined workflow.

Workers can be implemented in any language. Conductor's [SDKs](https://orkes.io/content/docs/how-tos/SDKs) provide support for worker frameworks that deliver features such as polling threads, metrics and server communication which aids in the worker creation process.

Each worker embodies the microservice design pattern and follows certain basic principles:

* Workers are stateless and do not implement any workflow-specific logic.  
* Each worker executes a very specific task and produces well-defined output given specific inputs are provided.
* Workers are meant to be idempotent (Or should be able to handle cases where the tasks that are partially executed get rescheduled due to timeouts etc).
* Workers do not implement the logic to handle retries etc, which is taken care of by the Conductor server.

## Tasks
Tasks are the building blocks of a workflow in Conductor.  A task can be an [operator](https://orkes.io/content/docs/getting-started/concepts/operators), [system task](https://orkes.io/content/docs/getting-started/concepts/system-tasks) 
or custom code [worker](https://orkes.io/content/docs/how-tos/Workers/write-workers) task written in **any** programming language. A typical Conductor workflow is a list of tasks that are executed until completion or the termination of the workflow. 

All tasks need to be registered with Conductor before implementing it in the workflow. A task can be reused within multiple workflows. You can begin with [creating tasks](https://orkes.io/content/docs/how-tos/Tasks/creating-tasks), and at a later point, you have the provision to [update](https://orkes.io/content/docs/how-tos/Tasks/updating-tasks)/[reuse](https://orkes.io/content/docs/how-tos/Tasks/reusing-tasks) tasks. You can also leverage the [task to domain](https://orkes.io/content/docs/how-tos/Tasks/task-domains) functionality where the task debugging and development can be done in the production environment. In addition, the transition between the different states of a task can be visualized from a [task's lifecycle](https://orkes.io/content/docs/how-tos/Tasks/task-lifecycle).
