# Build a Document Approval Workflow with Orkes Conductor

In this tutorial, you’ll build a document approval workflow using Orkes Conductor. This workflow is common for review and sign-off processes in academia, publishing, legal approvals, and similar domains.

The workflow allows two reviewers to approve or reject a submitted document. Based on their decisions, the user will either receive an approval email or be asked to revise and resubmit the paper.

## The document approval workflow

In this tutorial, you’ll build a workflow where:
- A user submits a paper along with their email and the paper’s title.
- **Reviewer 1** receives a human task to approve or reject within 24 hours.
        - If **approved**, it proceeds to **Reviewer 2**.
        - If **rejected**, the user is notified by email to revise and resubmit based on the feedback.
- If **Reviewer 2** approves, the user receives an approval email.
- If **Reviewer 2** rejects, the user gets an email with reviewer feedback.

The workflow is configured so that if the assigned reviewer does not act on the task within the SLA period of 24 hours, the task automatically becomes available for anyone to claim and complete. Learn more about [how assignment policies work for Human tasks](https://orkes.io/content/developer-guides/orchestrating-human-tasks#step-3-configure-the-human-task).

Here’s how the workflow looks like:

## Step 1: Create a SendGrid integration in Orkes Conductor

In this tutorial, we’ll use SendGrid to send emails. To do that, you must set up a SendGrid integration in your Orkes Conductor cluster.

:::info Prerequisites
- [A SendGrid API key](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys)
- [A verified sender email in SendGrid](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sendgrid/ui/sending-email/sender-verification)
:::

**To create a SendGrid integration:**
1. Go to [**Integrations**](https://developer.orkescloud.com/integrations) from the left navigation menu on your Conductor cluster.
2. Select **+ New integration**.
3. In the **Email** section, choose [**SendGrid Email**](https://orkes.io/content/integrations/email/sendgrid#step-2-add-an-integration-for-sendgrid-email).
4. Select **+ Add** and enter a name for the integration, API key, and a description.
5. Select **Save**.

## Step 2: Create a user form in Orkes Conductor

The workflow uses a Human task in Orkes Conductor to route documents for manual approval. Reviewers can complete approvals either through the Conductor UI or an external interface, such as an internal website or document approval portal. 

In this tutorial, you’ll use the Conductor UI to complete approvals. For this, a user form is to be created in Conductor.

**To create a user form:**
1. Go to [**Definitions** > **User Forms**](https://developer.orkescloud.com/human/templates) from the left navigation menu on your Conductor cluster.
2. Select **+ New form.**
3. In the **Code** tab, paste the following code:

```json
{
 "name": "Approval",
 "version": 1,
 "jsonSchema": {
   "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema",
   "properties": {
     "paperUrl": {
       "type": "string"
     },
     "approve": {
       "type": "string",
       "enum": [
         "Yes",
         " No"
       ]
     },
     "comments": {
       "type": "string"
     }
   },
   "required": [
     "approve",
     "comments"
   ]
 },
 "templateUI": {
   "type": "VerticalLayout",
   "elements": [
     {
       "type": "VerticalLayout",
       "elements": [
         {
           "type": "Control",
           "scope": "#/properties/paperUrl",
           "label": "Review doc",
           "options": {
             "readonly": true
           }
         }
       ]
     },
     {
       "type": "Control",
       "scope": "#/properties/approve",
       "label": "Approve document",
       "options": {}
     },
     {
       "type": "Control",
       "scope": "#/properties/comments",
       "label": "Comments"
     }
   ]
 }
}
```

4. Select **Save** > **Confirm**.

Your user form looks like this:

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/tutorial/doc-approval-user-form.png" alt="Doc approval user form in Orkes Conductor" width="100%" height="auto"></img></p>

## Step 3: Create a workflow in Orkes Conductor

Orkes Conductor lets you define workflows as JSON, through [SDKs](https://orkes.io/content/category/sdks), [APIs](https://orkes.io/content/category/ref-docs/api), or the [UI](http://orkes.io/content/developer-guides/build-workflows-using-ui). 

**To create a workflow using Conductor UI:**
1. Go to [**Definitions** > **Workflow**](https://developer.orkescloud.com/workflowDef) from the left navigation menu on your Conductor cluster.
2. Select **+ Define workflow**.
3. In the **Code** tab, paste the following code:

```json

   }
 ],
 "inputParameters": [
   "email",
   "paperUrl",
   "title"
 ],
 "schemaVersion": 2
}
```

4. Select **Save** > **Confirm**.

Next, replace all placeholder values with your actual reviewer information and SendGrid configuration details.

5. Select *reviewer_1* task and update the assignee to a valid Conductor user. In the Developer Edition, you’re the only available user, so assign the task to yourself. In other clusters, you can assign it to any user who has already been added to the Conductor cluster.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/tutorial/updating-human-task.png" alt="Updating Human task with reviewer details" width="100%" height="auto"></img></p>

6. Similarly, select the *reviewer_2* task and assign the second reviewer.
7. Select the *sendgrid* task and update the following parameters:
        - Set the **From** email to the verified sender address configured in [Step 1](/content/templates/examples/document-approvals#step-1-create-a-sendgrid-integration-in-orkes-conductor).
        - Set the **SendGrid Configuration** to the integration name created in [Step 1](/content/templates/examples/document-approvals#step-1-create-a-sendgrid-integration-in-orkes-conductor).

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/tutorial/updating-sendgrid-task.png" alt="Updating SendGrid task with email and integration details" width="100%" height="auto"></img></p>

9. Update the *sendgrid_1* and *send_approval_email* tasks with the same email and integration values.
10. Select **Save** > **Confirm**.

## Step 4: Execute workflow 

**To test the workflow:**
1. From your workflow definition, go to the **Run** tab.
2. Set the input parameter. For example:

```json
{
 "email": "jane.doe@acme.edu",
 "paperUrl": "<DOC-URL-FOR-APPROVAL>",
 "title": "<PAPER-TITLE>"
}
```

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/tutorial/executing-workflow.png" alt="Executing doc approval workflow" width="100%" height="auto"></img></p>

3. Select **Execute**.

This initiates the workflow and takes you to the workflow execution page.

### Completing the Human task

The workflow is running, and the first Human task is assigned to Reviewer 1.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/tutorial/workflow-in-execution-stage.png" alt="Document approval workflow execution" width="100%" height="auto"></img></p>

**To complete the Human tasks in the UI:**

1. Go to **Executions** > **Human Task**.
2. Select the **Task ID** to view the form.
3. Select **Claim**.
4. Review the document, select approval status, and leave comments.
5. Select **Complete** to submit the form.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/tutorial/approving-human-task.gif" alt="Reviewer approving a human task" width="100%" height="auto"></img></p>

The workflow then moves to the second human task, assigned to Reviewer 2. Reviewer 2 follows the same steps to complete their review.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/tutorial/workflow-execution-reaches-second-human-task.png" alt="Workflow execution at second human task" width="40%" height="auto"></img></p>

Once Reviewer 2 approves the document, the workflow is completed, and the user receives an approval email via SendGrid.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/tutorial/doc-approval-email.png" alt="Doc approval email received via SendGrid" width="100%" height="auto"></img></p>

If either reviewer rejects the document, the user is notified by email with the reviewer’s feedback.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/tutorial/rejecting-human-task.gif" alt="Reviewer rejecting a human task" width="100%" height="auto"></img></p>

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/tutorial/doc-rejection-email.png" alt="Doc rejection email received via SendGrid" width="100%" height="auto"></img></p>

Reviewer comments are passed dynamically to the email content using the Human task outputs.

```json
//SendGrid task definition
{
               "name": "sendgrid_1",
               "taskReferenceName": "sendgrid_ref_1",
               "inputParameters": {
                 "from": "<SENDGRID-VERIFIED-EMAIL>",
                 "to": "${workflow.input.email}",
                 "subject": "Research Paper Rejected",
                 "contentType": "text/plain",
                 "content": "Please revise your paper titled '${workflow.input.title}' based on the comment `${reviewer_2.output.comments}`.",
                 "sendgridConfiguration": "SendGrid"
               },
               "type": "SENDGRID",
}
```

This dynamic substitution ensures each user receives personalized feedback based on the reviewer’s input.

## Workflow modifications

This is a basic document approval workflow with a two-step review process. You can extend it to suit your needs by:

- Adding additional review stages.
- Integrating any LLM  for an AI-based review before human approval.
- Adjusting the review SLA (currently set to 24 hours) to meet your specific timing requirements.
- Configure the [Human task definition](https://orkes.io/content/developer-guides/orchestrating-human-tasks#step-2-define-a-human-task) with a [*timeoutSeconds*](https://orkes.io/content/error-handling#task-timeouts) value to enforce a task-level timeout. Additionally, [set up a trigger policy in Human task](https://orkes.io/content/developer-guides/orchestrating-human-tasks#step-3-configure-the-human-task) so that a notification workflow is automatically started if the task times out.
- Configuring escalations at each review level based on SLA breaches, allowing reassignment to alternate reviewers.
