# Build a Loan Approval Workflow with Orkes Conductor

In this tutorial, you’ll build a loan approval workflow using Orkes Conductor. This workflow combines AI-simulated credit scoring with validation checks and a manual review step for higher-value loans.

The workflow mimics real-world processes in banking and finance, where initial application screening is automated, but large loans require manual review before approval.

## The loan approval workflow

In this tutorial, you’ll build a workflow where:

- A customer submits a loan application with details such as loan amount, income, debt, employment status, and payment history.
- An AI model simulates a credit score based on the applicant’s details.
- The system validates the application for completeness and data accuracy.
- Based on conditions:
    - Approval is automated if the loan amount is $10,000 or less, and the customer receives an approval email.
    - If the loan amount is greater than $10,000, the application is sent for manual review.
        - If approved, the customer receives an approval email.
        - If rejected, the customer receives a rejection email.

The workflow is configured so that if the assigned reviewer does not act on the task within the SLA period of 96 hours, the task automatically gets terminated. This can be configured according to the business requirements. Learn more about [how assignment policies work for Human tasks](https://orkes.io/content/developer-guides/orchestrating-human-tasks#step-3-configure-the-human-task).

Here’s how the workflow looks like:

## Step 1: Create an OpenAI integration in Orkes Conductor

This workflow uses OpenAI to simulate credit scores.

:::info Prerequisites
- [An OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
:::

**To create an OpenAI integration:**

1. Go to [**Integrations**](https://developer.orkescloud.com/integrations) from the left navigation menu on your Conductor cluster.
2. Select **+ New integration**.
3. In the **AI/LLM** section, choose **[OpenAI](https://orkes.io/content/integrations/ai-llm/open-ai#step-2-add-an-integration-for-openai)**.
4. Select **+ Add** and enter a name for the integration, API key, and a description.
5. Select **Save**.

## Step 2: Create a SendGrid integration in Orkes Conductor

In this tutorial, we’ll use SendGrid to send emails. To do that, you must set up a SendGrid integration in your Orkes Conductor cluster.

:::info Prerequisites
- [A SendGrid API key](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys)
- [A verified sender email in SendGrid](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sendgrid/ui/sending-email/sender-verification)
:::

**To create a SendGrid integration:**
1. Go to [**Integrations**](https://developer.orkescloud.com/integrations) from the left navigation menu on your Conductor cluster.
2. Select **+ New integration**.
3. In the **Integrations** section, choose [**SendGrid Email**](https://orkes.io/content/integrations/email/sendgrid#step-2-add-an-integration-for-sendgrid-email).
4. Select **+ Add** and enter a name for the integration, API key, and a description.
5. Select **Save**.

## Step 3: Create a user form in Orkes Conductor

The workflow uses a Human task in Orkes Conductor to route the loan request for manual approval. Reviewers can complete approvals either through the Conductor UI or an external interface, such as an internal website or loan approval portal. 

In this tutorial, you’ll use the Conductor UI to complete approvals. For this, a user form is to be created in Conductor.

**To create a user form:**
1. Go to [**Definitions** > **User Forms**](https://developer.orkescloud.com/human/templates) from the left navigation menu on your Conductor cluster.
2. Select **+ New form.**
3. In the **Code** tab, paste the following code:

```json
{
 "name": "LoanApproval",
 "version": 1,
 "jsonSchema": {
   "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema",

Your user form looks like this:

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/tutorial/loan-approval-user-form.png" alt="Loan approval user form in Orkes Conductor" width="100%" height="auto"></img></p>

## Step 4: Create an AI prompt in Orkes Conductor

The workflow uses an LLM Text Complete task in Orkes Conductor to simulate the credit score using OpenAI. The task uses an AI prompt to facilitate this.

**To create an AI prompt:**

1. Go to [**Definitions** > **AI Prompts**](https://developer.orkescloud.com/ai_prompts) from the left navigation menu on your Conductor cluster.
2. Select **+ Add AI prompt**.
3. In the **Code** tab, paste the following code:

```json
{
 "name": "simulate_credit_score",
 "template": "You are a credit bureau simulator.  \nBased on the following applicant data, return ONLY a JSON object with a numeric credit_score between 300 and 850.\n\nApplicant data:\n- Loan amount: ${loan_amount}\n- Annual income: ${annual_income}\n- Monthly debt: ${monthly_debt}\n- Employment status: ${employment_status}\n- Payment history: ${payment_history}\n\nReturn ONLY this JSON object with no explanations, no code fences:\n\n{\n  \"credit_score\": <number>\n}",
 "description": "Generate a realistic credit score (300–850) based on the applicant's financial details.\n",
 "variables": [
   "monthly_debt",
   "loan_amount",
   "employment_status",
   "annual_income",
   "payment_history"
 ],
 "integrations": [
   "<YOUR-LLM-PRIVIDER>:<YOUR-LLM-MODEL>"
 ],
 "version": 1
}
```

4. Select **Save** > **Confirm Save**.

Update the **Model(s)** drop-down with the OpenAI integration created in [Step 1](/content/templates/examples/finance#step-1-create-an-openai-integration-in-orkes-conductor), and save the changes.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/tutorial/ai-prompt-for-loan-approval.gif" alt="Updating ai prompt with the integrated model" width="100%" height="auto"></img></p>

## Step 5: Create a workflow in Orkes Conductor

Orkes Conductor lets you define workflows as JSON, through [SDKs](https://orkes.io/content/category/sdks), [APIs](https://orkes.io/content/category/ref-docs/api), or the [UI](http://orkes.io/content/developer-guides/build-workflows-using-ui). 

**To create a workflow using Conductor UI:**
1. Go to [**Definitions** > **Workflow**](https://developer.orkescloud.com/workflowDef) from the left navigation menu on your Conductor cluster.
2. Select **+ Define workflow**.
3. In the **Code** tab, paste the following code:

```json

```

4. Select **Save** > **Confirm**.

Next, replace all placeholder values with your actual reviewer information and integrations.

5. Select the **LLM Text Complete** task, and update the *LLM provider* and *Model* with your configurations created in [Step 1](/content/templates/examples/finance#step-1-create-an-openai-integration-in-orkes-conductor).

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/tutorial/updating-llm-text-complete-task.png" alt="Updating LLM Text Complete task with AI integration" width="100%" height="auto"></img></p>

6. Select the **Human** task and update the assignee to a valid Conductor user. In the Developer Edition, you’re the only available user, so assign the task to yourself. In other clusters, you can assign it to any user who has already been added to the Conductor cluster.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/tutorial/updating-human-task-loan-approval.png" alt="Updating Human task with reviewer details" width="100%" height="auto"></img></p>

7. Select the *sendgrid* task and update the following parameters:
        - Set the **From** email to the verified sender address configured in [Step 2](/content/templates/examples/finance#step-2-create-a-sendgrid-integration-in-orkes-conductor).
        - Set the **SendGrid Configuration** to the integration name created in [Step 2](/content/templates/examples/finance#step-2-create-a-sendgrid-integration-in-orkes-conductor).

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/tutorial/updating-sendgrid-task-loan-approval.png" alt="Updating SendGrid task with email and integration details" width="100%" height="auto"></img></p>

8. Update the *sendgrid_1* and *sendgrid_2* tasks with the same email and integration values.
9. Select **Save** > **Confirm**.

## Step 6: Execute workflow 

**To test the workflow:**
1. From your workflow definition, go to the **Run** tab.
2. Set the input parameter. For example:

```json
{
  "loan_amount": 8000,
  "annual_income": 75000,
  "monthly_debt": 1100,
  "employment_status": "employment-doc.pdf",
  "payment_history": "bank-statement.pdf",
  "email": "john.doe@acme.com",
  "documents": "documents.pdf"
}
```

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/tutorial/executing-loan-approval-workflow.png" alt="Executing loan approval workflow" width="100%" height="auto"></img></p>

3. Select **Execute**.

This initiates the workflow and takes you to the workflow execution page. Since the loan amount here is less than $10,000, it goes into automated approval, and the user receives an email through SendGrid.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/tutorial/automated-approval-flow.png" alt="Automated approval flow" width="70%" height="auto"></img></p>

Now, let’s rerun the workflow for a loan over $10,000. Here’s the updated workflow input:

```json
{
  "loan_amount": 11000,
  "annual_income": 75000,
  "monthly_debt": 1100,
  "employment_status": "employment-doc.pdf",
  "payment_history": "bank-statement.pdf",
  "email": "john.doe@acme.com",
  "documents": "documents.pdf"
}
```

This initiates the workflow and takes you to the workflow execution page. Since the loan amount is over $ 10,000, it goes into manual approval.

### Completing the Human task

The workflow is running, and the Human task is assigned to the reviewer.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/tutorial/human-task-in-execution-stage.png" alt="Loan approval workflow execution" width="100%" height="auto"></img></p>

**To complete the Human tasks in the UI:**

1. Go to **Executions** > **Human Task**.
2. Select the **Task ID** to view the form.
3. Select **Claim**.
4. Review the loan details, select the approval status, and leave comments.
5. Select **Complete** to submit the form.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/tutorial/approving-human-task-loan-approval.gif" alt="Reviewer approving a human task" width="100%" height="auto"></img></p>

Once the reviewer approves the loan, the workflow is completed, and the user receives an approval email via SendGrid.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/tutorial/loan-approval-email.png" alt="Loan approval email received via SendGrid" width="100%" height="auto"></img></p>

If the reviewer rejects the loan, the user is emailed about the next steps.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/tutorial/rejecting-human-task-loan-approval.gif" alt="Reviewer rejecting a human task" width="100%" height="auto"></img></p>

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/tutorial/loan-rejection-email.png" alt="Loan rejection email received via SendGrid" width="100%" height="auto"></img></p>

## Workflow modifications

This loan approval workflow can be extended by:
