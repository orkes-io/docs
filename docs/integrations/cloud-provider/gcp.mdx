# GCP Integration with Orkes Conductor

To use AI tasks like [List Files](/content/reference-docs/ai-tasks/list-files) and [Parse Document](/content/reference-docs/ai-tasks/parse-document) that need to access files or documents stored in Google Cloud Storage (GCS), you must integrate your Conductor cluster with GCP. This integration is required when accessing private buckets or resources that aren’t publicly available. This guide explains how to integrate GCP with Orkes Conductor. Here’s an overview:

1. Get the required credentials from GCP.
2. Configure a new GCP integration in Orkes Conductor.
3. Set access limits for the integration to govern which applications or groups can use it.

## Step 1: Get the GCP credentials

To integrate GCP with Orkes Conductor, retrieve the following credentials from the Google Cloud console. You must also enable the Cloud Storage API for the selected GCP project.

- Project ID
- Location
- Service account JSON

### Get the project ID

**To get the project ID:**

1. Sign in to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new project or select an existing one.
3. Get the **Project ID** from the dashboard.

For more information, refer to the official documentation on [creating and managing projects in GCP](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects).

### Get the location

The region where your Google Cloud project or storage bucket is hosted.

For more information, refer to the official documentation on [Bucket location](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/locations#available-locations).

### Get the service account JSON

**To get the service account JSON:**

1. Go to **IAM & Admin** > **Service Accounts** from the left menu on your GCP console. 
2. Create a new service or select an existing one.
3. In the **Keys** tab, select **Add key** > **Create new key**.

4. Select the key type as **JSON**.
5. Select **Create** to download the JSON file.

To use GCP with Orkes Conductor, you must enable Cloud Storage from the GCP console.

### Enable Cloud Storage API

**To enable Cloud Storage API:**

1. Go to **APIs & Services** > **Enabled APIs & services** from the left menu on your GCP console.
2. Select **+ Enable APIs and Services**.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/enable-apis-and-services.png" alt="Enabling APIs and services from GCP console" width="100%" height="auto"/></p>

3. In the **API Library**, search for **Cloud Storage API**.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/cloud-storage-api.png" alt="Enabling Cloud Storage API" width="100%" height="auto"/></p>

4. Select **Enable**.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/enable-cloud-storage.png" alt="Enabling Cloud Storage API" width="70%" height="auto"/></p>

Once enabled, the Cloud Storage API is ready for use with your GCP project.

## Step 2: Add an integration for GCP

After obtaining the credentials, add a GCP integration to your Conductor cluster.

**To create a GCP integration:**

1. Go to **Integrations** from the left navigation menu on your Conductor cluster.
2. Select **+ New integration**.
3. In the **Integrations** section, choose **GCP**.
4. Select **+ Add** and enter the following parameters:

| Paremeters | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Integration name | A name for the integration. | 
| Project ID | The Project ID retrieved from the GCP console. | 
| Location | The region where your Google Cloud project or storage bucket is hosted. For example, **us-central1**. |
| Choose Service account credentials JSON | Upload the service account JSON file (generated previously), which is a key file containing the credentials for authenticating the Orkes Conductor cluster with the GCP services. | 
| Description | A description of the integration. |

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/gcp-integration.png" alt="GCP Integration with Orkes Conductor" width="60%" height="auto"/></p>

5. (Optional) Toggle the **Active** button off if you don’t want to activate the integration instantly.
6. Select **Save**.

## Step 3: Set access limits to integration

Once the integration is configured, set access controls to manage which [applications](https://orkes.io/content/access-control-and-security/applications) or [groups](https://orkes.io/content/access-control-and-security/users-and-groups#groups) can use the cloud provider.

**To provide access to an application or group:**

1. Go to **Access Control** > **Applications** or **Groups** from the left navigation menu on your Conductor cluster.
2. Create a new group/application or select an existing one.
3. In the **Permissions** section, select **+ Add Permission**.
4. In the **Integration** tab, select the required integration and toggle the necessary permissions.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/rbac-gcp.png" alt="Configuring RBAC for GCP Integration" width="70%" height="auto"/></p>

The group or application can now access the integration according to the configured permissions.

With the integration in place, you can now create workflows using the [List Files](/content/reference-docs/ai-tasks/list-files) task or the [Parse Document](/content/reference-docs/ai-tasks/parse-document) task.
