# Weaviate Integration with Orkes Conductor

To use system AI tasks in Orkes Conductor, you must integrate your Conductor cluster with the necessary vector database providers. This guide explains how to integrate Weaviate with Orkes Conductor. Here’s an overview:

1. Get the required credentials from Weaviate.
2. Configure a new Weaviate integration in Orkes Conductor.
3. Add classes to the integration.
4. Set access limits to the vector database to govern which applications or groups can use them.

## Step 1: Get the Weaviate credentials

To integrate Weaviate with Orkes Conductor, retrieve the API key and endpoint from the Weaviate Console. 

:::note Pre-requisites: 
For Weaviate Cloud:
1. Sign up for [Weaviate Cloud](https://console.weaviate.cloud/dashboard).
2. [Create a cluster](https://weaviate.io/developers/wcs/quickstart#create-a-weaviate-cluster).
3. [Create a collection (class)](https://weaviate.io/developers/wcs/tools/collections-tool#create-a-collection) within the cluster.
:::

**To get the API key and endpoint:**

1. Sign in to the [Weaviate Console](https://console.weaviate.cloud/dashboard).
2. Select your cluster and go to **Cluster details** > **Information**.
3. Copy the **REST Endpoint**.

4. Go to **Cluster details** > **API Keys**.
5. Copy the **Admin** key.

:::note
If you are using Weaviate locally, [set up a local instance](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/quickstart/local) and retrieve the API key and endpoint.

## Step 2: Add an integration for Weaviate

After obtaining the credentials, add a Weaviate integration to your Conductor cluster.

**To create a Weaviate integration:**

1. Go to **Integrations** from the left navigation menu on your Conductor cluster.
2. Select **+ New integration**.
3. In the **Vector Databases** section, choose **Weaviate**.
4. Select **+ Add** and enter the following parameters:

|  Parameters | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- | 
| Integration name | A name for the integration. |
| API Key | The API key from the Weaviate cluster. |
| Endpoint | The REST Endpoint from the Weaviate cluster. |
| Description | A description of the integration. |

5. (Optional) Toggle the **Active** button off if you don’t want to activate the integration instantly.
6. Select **Save**.

## Step 3: Add Weaviate classes

Once you’ve integrated Weaviate, the next step is to configure specific classes.

**To add a class to the Weaviate integration:**

1. Go to the **Integrations** page and select the **+** button next to the integration created.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/create-new-weaviate-integration-class.png" alt="Create Classes for Weaviate Integration" width="100%" height="auto"></img></p>

2. Select **+ New Class**.
3. Enter the **Class name** and a **Description**. 

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/create-new-weaviate-integration-class-model.png" alt="Create New Class for Weaviate Integration Model" width="60%" height="auto"></img></p>

4. (Optional) Toggle the **Active** button off if you don’t want to activate the class instantly.
5. Select **Save**.

This saves the classes for future use in AI tasks within Orkes Conductor.

## Step 4: Set access limits to integration

Once the integration is configured, set access controls to manage which applications or groups can use the Pinecone databases.

**To provide access to an application or group:**

1. Go to **Access Control** > **Applications** or **Groups** from the left navigation menu on your Conductor cluster.
2. Create a new group/application or select an existing one.
3. In the **Permissions** section, select **+ Add Permission**.
4. In the **Integration** tab, select the required vector database providers and toggle the necessary permissions.
5. Select **Add Permissions**. 

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/add-integration-permission-for-weaviate-db.png" alt="Add Permissions for Weaviate Database Integration" width="70%" height="auto"></img></p>

The group or application can now access the vector database according to the configured permissions.
With the integration in place, you can now create workflows using [AI/LLM tasks](https://orkes.io/content/category/reference-docs/ai-tasks).

:::info
To store data in a vector database, an embedding is to be generated by an AI model. You must also integrate an [AI model provider](https://orkes.io/content/category/integrations/ai-llm) of your choice to use this integration in workflows.
