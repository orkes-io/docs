# Anthropic Claude Integration with Orkes Conductor

To use system AI tasks in Orkes Conductor, you must integrate your Conductor cluster with the necessary AI/LLM providers. This guide explains how to integrate Anthropic Claude with Orkes Conductor. Here’s an overview:

1. Get the required credentials from Anthropic Claude.
2. Configure a new Anthropic Claude integration in Orkes Conductor.
3. Add models to the integration.
4. Set access limits to the AI model to govern which applications or groups can use them.

## Step 1: Get the Anthropic Claude credentials

To integrate Anthropic Claude with Orkes Conductor, retrieve the API key and endpoint from the Anthropic Console. 

**To get the API key:**

1. Sign in to the [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/).
2. Go to [API keys](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys) from the left menu.
3. Select **+ Create Key**.

5. Select **Add**.
6. Copy and store the generated key.

The default API endpoint for Anthropic Claude is https://api.anthropic.com/v1. Use this as the API endpoint when configuring the integration.

## Step 2: Add an integration for Anthropic Claude

After obtaining the credentials, add an Anthropic Claude integration to your Conductor cluster.

**To create an Anthropic Claude integration:**

1. Go to **Integrations** from the left navigation menu on your Conductor cluster.
2. Select **+ New integration**.
3. In the **AI/LLM** section, choose **Anthropic Claude**.
4. Select **+ Add** and enter the following parameters:

| Parameters | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Integration name | A name for the integration. |
| API Key | The API key copied previously from the Anthropic console. | 
| API Endpoint | Use the default API endpoint for Anthropic Claude, which is https://api.anthropic.com/v1. |
| Description | A description of the integration. |

5. (Optional) Toggle the **Active** button off if you don’t want to activate the integration instantly.
6. Select **Save**.

## Step 3: Add Anthropic Claude models

Once you’ve integrated Anthropic Claude, the next step is to configure specific models.

Anthropic Claude has different models, such as Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3 Sonnet, Claude 3 Haiku, and more, each designed for various use cases, such as text completion and embedding generation. Choose the model that best fits your use case.

**To add a model to the Anthropic Claude integration:**

1. Go to the **Integrations** page and select the **+** button next to the integration created.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/create-new-anthropic-claude-integration-model-from-integrations-page.png" alt="Create Anthropic Claude Integration Model from Listed Integrations" width="100%" height="auto"></img></p>

2. Select **+ New model**.
3. Enter the **Model name** and a **Description**. Get the complete [list of Anthropic Claude models](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/models-overview). 

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/create-new-anthropic-claude-integration-model.png" alt="Create Anthropic Claude Integration Model" width="70%" height="auto"></img></p>

4. (Optional) Toggle the **Active** button off if you don’t want to activate the model instantly.
5. Select **Save**.

This saves the model for future use in AI tasks within Orkes Conductor.

## Step 4: Set access limit to integration

Once the integration is configured, set access controls to manage which applications or groups can use the models.

**To provide access to an application or group:**

1. Go to **Access Control** > **Applications** or **Groups** from the left navigation menu on your Conductor cluster.
2. Create a new group/application or select an existing one.
3. In the **Permissions** section, select **+ Add Permission**.
4. In the **Integration** tab, select the required AI models and toggle the necessary permissions.
5. Select **Add Permissions**. 

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/rbac-anthropic-claude-integration.png" alt="Add Permissions for Integrations" width="70%" height="auto"></img></p>

The group or application can now access the AI model according to the configured permissions.

With the integration in place, you can now create workflows using [AI/LLM tasks](https://orkes.io/content/category/reference-docs/ai-tasks).
