# Azure OpenAI Integration with Orkes Conductor

To use system AI tasks in Orkes Conductor, you must integrate your Conductor cluster with the necessary AI/LLM providers. This guide explains how to integrate Azure OpenAI with Orkes Conductor. Here’s an overview:

1. Get the required credentials from Azure OpenAI.
2. Configure a new Azure OpenAI integration in Orkes Conductor.
3. Add models to the integration.
4. Set access limits to the AI model to govern which applications or groups can use them.

## Step 1: Get the Azure OpenAI credentials

To integrate Azure OpenAI with Orkes Conductor, retrieve the API key and endpoint from the Azure portal.

**To get the API key and endpoint:**

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. In **Azure services**, select **Azure OpenAI**.
3. Create a new resource or open an existing one.
4. Go to **Resource Management** > **Keys and Endpoint** in the left navigation menu.

5. Copy *KEY 1* or *KEY 2* as the API key.
6. Copy the endpoint. 

## Step 2: Add an integration for Azure OpenAI

After obtaining the credentials, add an Azure OpenAI integration to your Conductor cluster.

**To create an Azure OpenAI integration:**

1. Go to **Integrations** from the left navigation menu on your Conductor cluster.
2. Select **+ New integration**.
3. In the **AI/LLM** section, choose **Azure + OpenAI**.
4. Select **+ Add** and enter the following parameters:

| Parameters | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Integration name | A name for the integration. |
| API Key | The API key copied previously from the Azure portal. |
| Endpoint | The endpoint copied previously from the Azure portal. | 
| Description | A description of the integration. |

5. (Optional) Toggle the **Active** button off if you don’t want to activate the integration instantly.
6. Select **Save**.

## Step 3: Add Azure OpenAI models

Once you’ve integrated Azure OpenAI, the next step is to configure specific models.

Azure OpenAI has different models, such as text-davinci-003, text-embedding-ada-002, gpt-35-turbo, and more, each designed for various use cases, such as text completion and embedding generation. Choose the model that best fits your use case.

**To add a model to the Azure OpenAI integration:**

1. Go to the **Integrations** page and select the **+** button next to the integration created.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/create-new-azure-open-ai-integration-model-from-integrations-page.png" alt="Create Azure Open AI Integration Model from Listed Integrations" width="100%" height="auto"></img></p>

2. Select **+ New model**.
3. Enter the **Model name** and a **Description**. Get the complete [list of Azure OpenAI models](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models).

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/create-new-azure-open-ai-integration-model.png" alt="Create Azure Open AI Integration Model" width="60%" height="auto"></img></p>

4. (Optional) Toggle the **Active** button off if you don’t want to activate the model instantly.
5. Select **Save**.

This saves the model for future use in AI tasks within Orkes Conductor.

## Step 4: Set access limits to integration

Once the integration is configured, set access controls to manage which applications or groups can use the models.

**To provide access to an application or group:**

1. Go to **Access Control** > **Applications** or **Groups** from the left navigation menu on your Conductor cluster.
2. Create a new group/application or select an existing one.
3. In the **Permissions** section, select **+ Add Permission**.
4. In the **Integration** tab, select the required AI models and toggle the necessary permissions.
5. Select **Add Permissions**. 

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/add-integration-permission.png" alt="Add Permissions for Integrations" width="70%" height="auto"></img></p>

The group or application can now access the AI model according to the configured permissions.

With the integration in place, you can now create workflows using [AI/LLM tasks](https://orkes.io/content/category/reference-docs/ai-tasks).
