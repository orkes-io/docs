# OpenAI Integration with Orkes Conductor

To use system AI tasks in Orkes Conductor, you must integrate your Conductor cluster with the necessary AI/LLM providers. This guide explains how to integrate OpenAI with Orkes Conductor. Here’s an overview:

1. Get the required credentials from OpenAI.
2. Configure a new OpenAI integration in Orkes Conductor.
3. Add models to the integration.
4. Set access limits to the AI model to govern which applications or groups can use it.

## Step 1: Get the OpenAI credentials

To integrate OpenAI with Orkes Conductor, retrieve the API key from the OpenAI platform. Two types of keys can be generated:

- **User account key**–Tied to your individual account. This key can make requests on behalf of the selected project.
- **Service account key**–Linked to a bot user (service account) that is added to the project.

**To get the API key:**

1. Sign in to the [OpenAI platform](https://platform.openai.com/).
2. Go to **Dashboard** > **[API keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)** from the left menu and select **+ Create new secret key**.

3. In **Owned by**, select **You**.

4. Configure the following parameters:

- **Name**–A name for your secret.
- **Project**–Select the required project. 
- **Permissions**–Select the required permissions. Supported values: *All*, *Restricted*, and *Read only*.

5. Select **Create secret key**.
6. Copy and store the generated key securely, as it is shown only once.

**To get the API key:**

1. Sign in to the [OpenAI platform](https://platform.openai.com/).
2. Go to **Dashboard** > **[API keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)** from the left menu and select **+ Create new secret key**.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/create-new-api-key.png" alt="Create new API Keys in OpenAI API platform" width="100%" height="auto"></img></p>

3. In **Owned by**, select **Service account**.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/generating-api-token-service-account.png" alt="Create new API Keys in OpenAI API platform" width="40%" height="auto"></img></p>

4. Configure the following parameters:

- **Service Key Name**–A name for your service account key.
- **Project**–Select the required project. 

5. Select **Create secret key**.
6. Copy and store the generated key securely, as it is shown only once.
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 2: Add an integration for OpenAI

After obtaining the credentials, add an OpenAI integration to your Conductor cluster.

**To create an OpenAI integration:**

1. Go to **Integrations** from the left navigation menu on your Conductor cluster.
2. Select **+ New integration**.
3. In the **AI/LLM** section, choose **OpenAI**.
4. Select **+ Add** and enter the following parameters:

| Parameters | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Integration name | A name for the integration. |
| API Key | The API key copied previously from the OpenAI platform.
| Description | A description of the integration. | 

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/create-new-open-ai-integration.png" alt="OpenAI Integration with Orkes Conductor" width="70%" height="auto"></img></p>

5. (Optional) Toggle the **Active** button off if you don’t want to activate the integration instantly.
6. Select **Save**.

## Step 3: Add OpenAI models

Once you’ve integrated OpenAI, the next step is to configure specific models.

OpenAI has different models, such as text-davinci-003, text-embedding-ada-002, gpt-35-turbo, and more, each designed for various use cases, such as text completion and embedding generation. Choose the model that best fits your use case.

**To add a model to the OpenAI integration:**

1. Go to **Integrations** and select the **+** button next to the integration created.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/create-new-model-for-open-ai-integration.png" alt="Create new model for OpenAI Integration" width="100%" height="auto"></img></p>

2. Select **+ New model**.
3. Enter the **Model name** and a **Description**. Get the complete [list of OpenAI models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview).

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/creating-new-model-for-open-ai-integration.png" alt="Creating new model for OpenAI Integration" width="70%" height="auto"></img></p>

4. (Optional) Toggle the **Active** button off if you don’t want to activate the model instantly.
5. Select **Save**.

This saves the model for future use in AI tasks within Orkes Conductor.

## Step 4: Set access limits to integration

Once the integration is configured, set access controls to manage which [applications](https://orkes.io/content/access-control-and-security/applications) or [groups](https://orkes.io/content/access-control-and-security/users-and-groups#groups) can use the models.

**To provide access to an application or group:**

1. Go to **Access Control** > **Applications** or **Groups** from the left navigation menu on your Conductor cluster.
2. Create a new group/application or select an existing one.
3. In the **Permissions** section, select **+ Add Permission**.
4. In the **Integration** tab, select the required AI models and toggle the necessary permissions.
5. Select **Add Permissions**. 

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/add-integration-permission-for-azure-open-ai.png" alt="Add Permissions for Azure OpenAI Integration" width="70%" height="auto"></img></p>

The group or application can now access the AI model according to the configured permissions.

With the integration in place, you can now create workflows using [AI/LLM tasks](https://orkes.io/content/category/reference-docs/ai-tasks).
