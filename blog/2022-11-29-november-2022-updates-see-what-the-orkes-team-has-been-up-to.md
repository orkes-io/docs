Many exciting things are happening as we work closely with our customers and the broader developer community. This blog post is intended to recap what the team at Orkes has been up to during the past few weeks. We will be covering two broad categories - product updates and community engagement. Do let us know your thoughts and feedback by reaching out to us on our [Slack channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T02KG20GJ1Z/C02K1B5PM0X) or by [setting up a meeting with us](https://share.hsforms.com/1TmggEej4TbCm0sTWKFDahwcfl4g).

We kick-started Q4 2022 with a set of great events, including but not limited to KubeCon + CloudNativeCon22, IBC22, and Orkes x MongoDB meetup. In case you couldn’t make it to these events, we’ve got you covered - more events are on the way!

Now let’s go through the [product](/content/blog/november-2022-updates-see-what-the-orkes-team-has-been-up-to#product-updates) and [events](/content/blog/november-2022-updates-see-what-the-orkes-team-has-been-up-to#event-updates) updates from Orkes.

## Product Updates

### Webhook

**Nov 20, 2022**

Integration of different systems with Conductor can be enabled using Webhooks. You can now seamlessly send real-time updates from third-party systems, such as Slack, Twitter, etc., to Conductor via Webhook. Webhooks can be used to listen for a particular type of event to occur, or you can also start a new workflow when an event occurs. [Learn more](https://orkes.io/content/docs/reference-docs/system-tasks/webhook-task).

### Metadata Migration

**Nov 17, 2022**

We’re pleased to announce metadata migration that facilitates moving workflows and task definitions between various environments. This comes into use when workflows and tasks need to be tested before deploying into the production environment. Once testing is finished, you can then easily move the definitions from development to testing to production environments.

### HTTP Poll Task

**Nov 10, 2022**

The HTTP Poll task is a powerful mechanism to check whether certain events occur in an external system. It is a smart polling mechanism that invokes the HTTP API, parses the response, and evaluates conditions (until the specified condition matches) to infer whether further polling is required. [Learn more](https://orkes.io/content/docs/reference-docs/system-tasks/http-poll-task).

### GraalJS for Inline Task

**Oct 24, 2022**

Ever since the launch of the Inline task, we have been receiving frequent requests to enable the GraalJS evaluator type. You can now use the GraalJS evaluator type while configuring Inline tasks in your workflows. It can be used to evaluate Javascript expressions using GraalJS.
