## Event Updates

### DeveloperWeek 2023

**Feb 15-17, 2023: Oakland, CA**

Uniting the global developer community, [DeveloperWeek 2023](https://www.developerweek.com/) is the world’s largest developer & engineering expo held at Oakland Convention Center, California. With 8000+ attendees, including engineers, software developers/architects, technical professionals & IT leaders from over 115+ countries, the conference was a platform for networking, learning & upgrading skills.

With more and more companies embarking on their cloud journey, microservice adoption has become an integral part of the business processes and data processing pipelines. In this context, it is critical that the right patterns and approaches are used when teams move into this model. At the [API and Microservices](https://www.developerweek.com/conference/api-microservices-conference/) session in the DeveloperWeek, our CTO Viren Baraiya talked about “Building & Scaling distributed stateful applications”, which covered some of the best practices in this journey and how a well-formed orchestrator can empower teams to build their critical applications with high levels of scale and resiliency.

The guide is structured in a way that includes probable cause & solutions, and we are starting with addressing some of the common workflow definition errors. We will continue to add more sections as we encounter additional issues.
