## Product Updates

### Start Workflow
**Dec 1, 2022**

We’re delighted to announce yet another add-on to our operator tasks - Start Workflow. The Start Workflow task is used to start another workflow from your existing workflow and is not dependent on its completion. Unlike the sub-workflow task, this task won’t wait for the started task to complete. [Learn more](https://orkes.io/content/docs/reference-docs/start-workflow).
