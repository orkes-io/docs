Our customers run some of their core and mission-critical workloads on Orkes. Trust from these customers is an earned privilege and it is Orkes’ top priority that we maintain and build upon this fundamental value. One key pillar of trust is operating with high levels of security across multiple dimensions, such as hardened infrastructure, secure software development & operational processes and in-depth auditing by third parties against industry-leading benchmarks.

At Orkes, it is our core tenet to have world-class security embedded in everything we do so that our customers’ workloads and their data are safe when using Orkes products and services. That is why we embarked on attaining multiple levels of SOC 2 compliance - the most fundamental security certification that our customers value. And I’m thrilled to announce that after a thorough audit by an independent auditor spanning multiple months of the observation period, **we are now SOC 2 Type 2 compliant!**

## How does SOC2 Type 2 compliance help customers?

Service Organization Control (SOC), developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), defines how a company handles sensitive data. SOC 2 is designed for service providers who store customer data in the cloud. This rigorous, independent assessment of our internal security controls verifies our adherence to the highest standards across all aspects of our technology and business.

If you are an Orkes customer or considering being one, rest assured that your workloads and data will be in a cloud ecosystem that is fully compliant with SOC 2 Type 2 standards. This also means that if you require SOC 2 Type 2 compliance for yourselves, using Orkes Cloud for your microservices and workflow orchestration use cases ensures you will be able to achieve and maintain that compliance.

## Ongoing Commitment

The team at Orkes has put a lot of hard work into this effort and we will continue to do more of that and work towards future compliances that are important for our customers.
